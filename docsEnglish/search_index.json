I dedicate this book to the memory of two giants who helped me, and everyone who knew them, see farther and live better lives: James C. Hickman and Joseph P. Sullivan. Forward Actuaries and other financial analysts quantify situations using data – we are ‘numbers’ people. Many of our approaches and models are stylized, based on years of experience and investigations performed by legions of analysts. However, the financial and risk management world evolves rapidly. Many analysts are confronted with new situations in which tried-and-true methods simply do not work. This is where a toolkit like regression analysis comes in. Regression is the study of relationships among variables. It is a generic statistics discipline that is not restricted to the financial world – it has applications in fields of social, biological and physical sciences. You can use regression techniques to investigate large and complex data sets. To familiarize you with regression, this book explores many examples and data sets based on actuarial and financial applications. This is not to say that you will not encounter applications outside of the financial world (for example, an actuary may need to understand the latest scientific evidence on genetic testing for underwriting purposes). However, as you become acquainted with this toolkit, you will see how regression can be applied in many (and sometimes new) situations. Who Is This Book For? This book is written for financial analysts who face uncertain events and wish to quantify these events using empirical information. No industry knowledge is assumed although readers will find the reading much easier if they have an interest in the applications discussed here! This book is designed for students who are just being introduced to the field as well as industry analysts who would like to brush up on old techniques and (for the later chapters) get an introduction to new developments. To read this book, I assume knowledge comparable to a one semester introduction to probability and statistics - Appendix A1 provides a brief review to brush up if you are rusty. Actuarial students in North America will have a one-year introduction to probability and statistics - this type of introduction will help readers grasp concepts more quickly than a one semester background. Finally, readers will find matrix, or linear, algebra helpful, although not a prerequisite for reading this text. Different readers are interested in understanding statistics at different levels. This book is written to accommodate the ‘armchair reader,’ that is, one who passively reads and does not get involved by attempting the exercises in the text. Consider an analogy to football, or any other game. Just like the armchair quarterback of football, there is a great deal that you can learn about the game just by watching. However, if you want to sharpen your skills, you have to go out and play the game. If you do the exercises or reproduce the statistical analyses in the text, you will become a better player. Still, this text is written by interweaving examples with the basic principles. Thus, even the armchair reader can obtain a solid understanding of regression techniques through this text. What Is This Book About? The Table of Contents provides an overview of the topics covered, organized into four parts. The first part introduces linear regression. This is the core material of the book, with refreshers on mathematical statistics, distributions and matrix algebra woven in as needed. The second part is devoted to topics in times series. Why integrate time series topics into a regression book? The reasons are simple, yet compelling; most accounting, financial and economic data become available over time. Although cross-sectional inferences are useful, business decisions need to be made in real time with currently available data. Chapters 7-10 introduce time series techniques that can be readily accomplished using regression tools (and there are many). Nonlinear regression is the subject of the third part. Many modern day ‘predictive modeling’ tools are based on nonlinear regression - these are the workhorses of statistical shops in the financial and risk management industry. The fourth part concerns ‘actuarial applications,’ topics that I have found relevant in my research and consulting work in financial risk management. The first four chapters of this part consists of variations of regression models that are particularly useful in risk management. The last two chapters focus on communications, specifically, report writing and designing graphs. Communicating information is an important aspect of every technical discipline and statistics is certainly no exception. How Does This Book Deliver Its Message? Chapter Development. Each chapter has several examples interwoven with theory. In chapters where a model is introduced, I begin with an example and discuss the data analysis without regard to the theory. This analysis is presented at an intuitive level, without reference to a specific model. This is straightforward, because it amounts to little more than curve fitting. The theme is to have students summarize data sensibly without having the notion of a model obscure good data analysis. Then, an introduction to the theory is provided in the context of the introductory example. One or more additional examples follow that reinforce the theory already introduced and provide a context for explaining additional theory. In Chapters 5 and 6, that do not introduce models but rather techniques for analysis, I begin with an introduction of the technique. This introduction is then followed by an example that reinforces the explanation. In this way, the data analysis can be easily omitted without loss of continuity, if time is a concern. Real Data. Many of the exercises ask the reader to work with real data. The need for working with real data is well documented; for example, see Hogg (1972) or Singer and Willett (1990). Some criteria of Singer and Willett for judging a good data set include: (1) authenticity, (2) availability of background information, (3) interest and relevance to substantive learning, and (4) availability of elements with which readers can identify. Of course, there are some important disadvantages to working with real data. Data sets can quickly become outdated. Further, the ideal data set to illustrate a specific statistical issue is difficult to find. This is because with real data, almost by definition, several issues occur simultaneously. This makes it difficult to isolate a specific aspect. I particularly enjoy working with large data sets. The larger the data set, the greater is the need for statistics to summarize the information content. Statistical Software and Data. My goal in writing this text is to reach a broad group of students and industry analysts. Thus, to avoid excluding large segments, I chose not to integrate any specific statistical software package into the text. Nonetheless, because of the applications orientation, it is critical that the methodology presented be easily accomplished using readily available packages. For the course taught at the University of Wisconsin, I use the statistical packages SAS and R. On the book web site, http://research.bus.wisc.edu/RegActuaries users will find scripts written in SAS and R for the analysis presented in the text. The data are available in text format, allowing readers to employ any statistical packages that they wish. When you see a display such as this in the margin, you will also be able to find this data set () on the book web site. Technical Supplements. The technical supplements reinforce and extend the results in the main body of the text by giving a more formal, mathematical treatment of the material. This treatment is in fact a supplement because the applications and examples are described in the main body of the text. For readers with sufficient mathematical background, the supplements provide additional material that is useful in communicating to technical audiences. The technical supplements provide a deeper, and broader, coverage of applied regression analysis. I believe that analysts should have an idea of ‘what is going on under the hood,’ or ‘how the engine works.’ Most of these topics will be omitted from the first reading of the material. However, as you work with regression, you will be confronted with questions on ‘Why?’ and you will need to get into the details to see exactly how a certain technique works. Further, the technical supplements provide a menu of optional items that an instructor may wish to cover. Suggested Courses. There is a wide variety of topics that can go into a regression course. Here are some suggested courses. The course that I teach at the University of Wisconsin is the first on the list in the following table. \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{ll} \\begin{array}{lll} \\hline \\textbf{Audience} &amp; \\textbf{Nature of Course}&amp; \\textbf{Suggested Chapters} \\\\ \\hline \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Survey of regression and} &amp; \\text{Chapters } 1-8 ,11-13, 20-21,\\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; ~~~\\text{time series models} &amp; ~~~\\text{main body of text only} \\\\ \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Regression and time} &amp; \\text{ Chapters } 1-8, 20-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; ~~~\\text{series models} &amp; ~~~\\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Regression modeling} &amp; \\text{Chapters } 1-6, 11-13, 20-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; &amp; ~~~ \\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\text{Background in statistics}&amp; \\text{Actuarial regression}&amp; \\text{ Chapters } 10-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{and linear regression}&amp; ~~~\\text{models} &amp; ~~~ \\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array} } \\] In addition to these suggested courses, this book is designed for supplemental reading for a time series course as well as a reference book for industry analysts. My hope is that college students who use the beginning parts of the book in their university course will find the later chapters helpful in their industry positions. In this way I hope to promote life-long learning! Acknowledgements It is appropriate to begin the acknowledgement section by thanking the students in the actuarial program here at the University of Wisconsin; students are important partners in the knowledge creation and dissemination business at universities. Through their questions and feedback, I have learned a tremendous amount over the years. I have also benefited from assistance from those who have helped me pull together all the pieces for this book, specifically, Missy Pinney, Peng Shi, Yunjie (Winnie) Sun and Ziyan Xie. I have enjoyed working with several former students and colleagues on regression problems over the recent years, including Katrien Antonio, Jie Gao, Paul Johnson, Margie Rosenberg, Jiafeng Sun, Emil Valdez and Ping Wang. Their contributions are reflected indirectly throughout the text. Because of my long association with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I am reluctant to go back further in time and provide a longer list for fear of missing important individuals. I have also been fortunate to have a more recent association with the Insurance Services Office (ISO). Colleagues at ISO have provided me with important insights into applications. Through this text that features applications of regression into actuarial and financial industry problems, I hope to encourage the fostering of additional partnerships between academia and industry. I am pleased to acknowledge detailed reviews that I have received from colleagues Tim Welnetz and Margie Rosenberg. I also wish to thank Bob Miller for permission to include our joint work on designing effective graphs in Chapter 21. Bob has taught me a lot about regression over the years.

Regression analysis is a statistical method that is widely used in many fields of study, with actuarial science being no exception. This chapter provides an introduction to the role of the normal distribution in regression, the use of logarithmic transformations in specifying regression relationships and the sampling basis that is critical for inferring regression results to broad populations of interest. 1.1 What is Regression Analysis? Statistics is about data. As a discipline, it is about the collection, summarization and analysis of data to make statements about the real world. When analysts collect data, they are really collecting information that is quantified, that is, transformed to a numerical scale. There are easy, well-understood rules for reducing the data, using either numerical or graphical summary measures. These summary measures can then be linked to a theoretical representation, or model, of the data. With a model that is calibrated by data, statements about the world can be made. Statistical methods have had a major impact on several fields of study. In the area of data collection, the careful design of sample surveys is crucial to market research groups and to the auditing procedures of accounting firms. Experimental design is a second subdiscipline devoted to data collection. The focus of experimental design is on constructing methods of data collection that will extract information in the most efficient way possible. This is especially important in fields such as agriculture and engineering where each observation is expensive, possibly costing millions of dollars. Other applied statistical methods focus on managing and predicting data. Process control deals with monitoring a process over time and deciding when intervention is most fruitful. Process control helps manage the quality of goods produced by manufacturers. Forecasting is about extrapolating a process into the future, whether it be sales of a product or movements of an interest rate. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to analyze data. As we will see, the distinguishing feature of this method is the ability to make statements about variables after having controlled for values of known explanatory variables. Important as other methods are, it is regression analysis that has been most influential. To illustrate, an index of business journals, ABI/INFORM, lists over twenty-four thousand articles using regression techniques over the thirty-year period 1978-2007. And these are only the applications that were considered innovative enough to be published in scholarly reviews! Regression analysis of data is so pervasive in modern business that it is easy to overlook the fact that the methodology is barely over 120 years old. Scholars attribute the birth of regression to the 1885 presidential address of Sir Francis Galton to the anthropological section of the British Association of the Advancement of Sciences. In that address, described in Stigler (1986), Galton provided a description of regression and linked it to normal curve theory. His discovery arose from his studies of properties of natural selection and inheritance. To illustrate a data set that can be analyzed using regression methods, Table 1.1 displays some data included in Galton’s 1885 paper. This table displays the heights of 928 adult children, classified by an index of their parents’ height. Here, all female heights were multiplied by 1.08, and the index was created by taking the average of the father’s height and rescaled mother’s height. Galton was aware that the parents’ and the adult child’s height could each be adequately approximated by a normal curve. In developing regression analysis, he provided a single model for the joint distribution of heights.

Thus, we use the term explanatory variable for measurements that provide information about a variable of interest. Regression analysis is a method to quantify the relationship between a variable of interest and explanatory variables. The methodology used to study the data in Table 1.1 can also be used to study actuarial and other risk management problems, the thesis of this book. 1.2 Fitting Data to a Normal Distribution Historically, the normal distribution had a pivotal role in the development of regression analysis. It continues to play an important role, although we will be interested in extending regression ideas to highly ‘non-normal’ data. Formally, the normal curve is defined by the function \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{f}(y)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma ^{2}% }\\left( y-\\mu \\right) ^{2}\\right) . \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This curve is a probability density function with the whole real line as its domain. From equation (1.1), we see that the curve is symmetric about \\(\\mu\\) (the mean and median). The degree of peakedness is controlled by the parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). These two parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\), are known as the location and scale parameters, respectively. Appendix A3.1 provides additional details about this curve, including a graph and tables of its cumulative distribution that we will use throughout the text. The normal curve is also depicted in Figure 1.1, a display of a now out-of-date German currency note, the ten Deutsche Mark. This note contains the image of German Carl Gauss, an eminent mathematician whose name is often linked with the normal curve (it is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian curve). Gauss developed the normal curve in connection with the theory of least squares for fitting curves to data in 1809, about the same time as related work by the French scientist Pierre LaPlace. According to Stigler (1986), there was quite a bit of acrimony between these two scientists about the priority of discovery! The normal curve was first used as an approximation to histograms of data around 1835 by Adolph Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and social scientist. Like many good things, the normal curve had been around for some time, since about 1720 when Abraham de Moivre derived it for his work on modeling games of chance. The normal curve is popular because it is easy to use and has proved to be successful in many applications. Figure 1.1: Ten Deutsche Mark. German currency featuring scientist Gauss and the normal curve. Example: Massachusetts Bodily Injury Claims. For our first look at fitting the normal curve to a set of data, we consider data from Rempala and Derrig (2005). They considered claims arising from automobile bodily injury insurance coverages. These are amounts incurred for outpatient medical treatments that arise from automobile accidents, typically sprains, broken collarbones and the like. The data consists of a sample of 272 claims from Massachusetts that were closed in 2001 (by ‘closed,’ we mean that the claim is settled and no additional liabilities can arise from the same accident). Rempala and Derrig were interested in developing procedures for handling mixtures of ‘typical’ claims and others from providers who reported claims fraudulently. For this sample, we consider only those typical claims, ignoring the potentially fraudulent ones. Table 1.2 provides several statistics that summarize different aspects of the distribution. Claim amounts are in units of logarithms of thousands of dollars. The average logarithmic claim is 0.481, corresponding to $1,617.77 (=1000 \\(\\exp(0.481)\\)). The smallest and largest claims are -3.101 (45 dollars) and 3.912 (50,000 dollars), respectively. Table 1.2: Summary Statistics of Massachusetts Automobile Bodily Injury Claims Number Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum 25th Percentile 75th Percentile Claims 272 0.481 0.793 1.101 -3.101 3.912 -0.114 1.168 For completeness, here are a few definitions. The sample is the set of data available for analysis, denoted by \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\). Here, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, \\(y_1\\) represents the first observation, \\(y_2\\) the second, and so on up to \\(y_n\\) for the \\(nth\\) observation. Here are a few important summary statistics. Basic Summary Statistics The mean is the average of observations, that is, the sum of the observations divided by the number of units. Using algebraic notation, the mean is \\[ \\overline{y}=\\frac{1}{n}\\left( y_1 + \\cdots + y_n \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i. \\] The median is the middle observation when the observations are ordered by size. That is, it is the observation at which 50% are below it (and 50% are above it). The standard deviation is a measure of the spread, or scale, of the distribution. It is computed as \\[ s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^{2}} . \\] A percentile is a number at which a specified fraction of the observations is below it, when the observations are ordered by size. For example, the 25th percentile is that number so that 25% of observations are below it. To help visualize the distribution, Figure 1.2 displays a histogram of the data. Here, the height of the each rectangle shows the relative frequency of observations that fall within the range given by its base. The histogram provides a quick visual impression of the distribution; it shows that the range of the data is approximately (-4,4), the central tendency is slightly greater than zero and that the distribution is roughly symmetric. Normal Curve Approximation. Figure 1.2 also shows a normal curve superimposed, using \\(\\overline{y}\\) for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(s_y^{2}\\) for \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). With the normal curve, only two quantities (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\)) are required to summarize the entire distribution. For example, Table 1.2 shows that 1.168 is the 75th percentile, which is approximately the 204th (\\(=0.75\\times 272\\)) largest observation from the entire sample. From the equation (1.1) normal distribution, we have that \\(z=(y-\\mu )/\\sigma\\) is a standard normal, of which 0.675 is the 75th percentile. Thus, \\(\\overline{y}+0.675s_y=\\) \\(0.481+0.675\\times 1.101=1.224\\) is the 75th percentile using the normal curve approximation.

A quick visual inspection of a variable’s distribution can reveal some surprising features that are hidden by statistics, numerical summary measures. The box plot, also known as a ‘box and whiskers’ plot, is one such graphical device. Figure 1.3 illustrates a box plot for the bodily injury claims. Here, the box captures the middle 50% of the data, with the three horizontal lines corresponding to the 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles, reading from top to bottom. The horizontal lines above and below the box are the ‘whiskers.’ The upper whisker is 1.5 times the interquartile range (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles) above the 75th percentile. Similarly, the lower whisker is 1.5 times the interquartile range below the 25th percentile. Individual observations outside the whiskers are denoted by small circular plotting symbols, and are referred to as ‘outliers.’ Figure 1.3: Box plot of bodily injury claims.

However, by their very flexibility, graphs can also readily deceive the analyst. Chapter 21 will underscore this point. For example, Figure 1.4 is a re-drawing of Figure 1.2; the difference is that Figure 1.4 uses more, and finer, rectangles. This finer analysis reveals the asymmetric nature of the sample distribution that was not evident in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.4: Redrawing of Figure 1.2 with an increased number of rectangles. R Code to Produce Figure 1.4 hist(LOGCLAIMS, freq=FALSE, nclass=32, main=&quot;&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) mtext(&quot;Density&quot;, side=2, at=.75,las=1, adj=.7,cex=1.1) lines(x,y) Quantile-Quantile Plots. Increasing the number of rectangles can unmask features that were not previously apparent; however, there are in general fewer observations per rectangle meaning that the uncertainty of the relative frequency estimate increases. This represents a trade-off. Instead of forcing the analyst to make an arbitrary decision about the number of rectangles, an alternative is to use a graphical device for comparing a distribution to another known as a quantile-quantile, or qq, plot. Figure 1.5 illustrates a \\(qq\\) plot for the bodily injury data using the normal curve as a reference distribution. For each point, the vertical axis gives the quantile using the sample distribution. The horizontal axis gives the corresponding quantity using the normal curve. For example, earlier we considered the 75th percentile point. This point appears as (1.168, 0.675) on the graph. To interpret a \\(qq\\) plot, if the quantile points lie along the superimposed line, then the sample and the normal reference distribution have the same shape. (This line is defined by connecting the 75th and 25th percentiles.) In Figure 1.5, the small sample percentiles are consistently smaller than the corresponding values from the standard normal, indicating that the distribution is skewed to the left. The difference in values at the ends of the distribution are due to the outliers noted earlier that could also be interpreted as the sample distribution having larger tails than the normal reference distribution.

R Code to Produce Figure 1.5 qqnorm(LOGCLAIMS, main=&quot;&quot;, las=1, ylab=&quot;&quot;) mtext(&quot;Sample Quantiles&quot;, side=2, at=4.5, las=1,cex=1.1,adj=.4) qqline(LOGCLAIMS) 1.3 Power Transforms In the Section 1.2 example, we considered claims without justifying the use of the logarithmic scaling. When analyzing variables such as assets of firms, wages of individuals and housing prices of households in business and economic applications, it is common to consider logarithmic instead of the original units. A log transform retains the original ordering (for example, large wages remain large on the log wage scale) but serves to ‘pull in’ extreme values of the distribution. To illustrate, Figure 1.6 shows the bodily injury claims distribution in (thousands of) dollars. In order to graph the data meaningfully, the largest observation ($50,000) was removed prior to making this plot. Even with this observation removed, Figure 1.6 shows that the distribution is heavily lop-sided to the right, with several large values of claims appearing. Distributions that are lopsided in one direction or the other are known as skewed. Figure 1.6 is an example of a distribution skewed to the right, or positively skewed. Here, the tail of the distribution on the right is longer and there is a greater concentration of mass to the left. In contrast, a left-skewed, or negatively skewed distribution, has a longer tail on the left and a greater concentration of mass to the right. Many insurance claims distributions are right-skewed (see the text by Klugman, Panjer and Willmot, 2008, for extensive discussions). As we saw in Figures 1.4 and 1.5, a logarithmic transformation yields a distribution that is only mildly skewed to the left. Figure 1.6: Distribution of Bodily Injury Claims. Observations are in (thousands of) dollars with the largest observation omitted.. R Code to Produce Figure 1.6 injury3 = subset(injury, claims &lt; 25 ) CLAIMS25 &lt;- injury3$claims par(mar=c(4.2,4,1.2,.2),cex=1.1) hist(CLAIMS25, freq=FALSE, main=&quot;&quot;, las=1, ylab=&quot;&quot;, xlab=&quot;CLAIMS&quot;) mtext(&quot;Density&quot;, side=2, at=.28, las=1,cex=1.1) Logarithmic transformations are used extensively in applied statistics work. One advantage is that they serve to symmetrize distributions that are skewed. More generally, we consider power transforms, also known as the Box-Cox family of transforms. Within this family of transforms, in lieu of using the response \\(y\\), we use a transformed, or rescaled version, \\(y^{\\lambda}\\). Here, the power \\(\\lambda\\) (lambda, a Greek ‘el’) is a number that may be user specified. Typical values of \\(\\lambda\\) that are used in practice are \\(\\lambda\\)=1, 1/2, 0 or -1. When we use \\(\\lambda =0\\), we mean \\(\\ln (y)\\), that is, the natural logarithmic transform. More formally, the Box-Cox family can be expressed as \\[ y^{(\\lambda )}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{y^{\\lambda }-1}{\\lambda } &amp; \\lambda \\neq 0 \\\\ \\ln (y) &amp; \\lambda =0 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] As we will see, because regression estimates are not affected by location and scale shifts, in practice we do not need to subtract one nor divide by \\(\\lambda\\) when rescaling the response. The advantage of the above expression is that, if we let \\(\\lambda\\) approach 0, then \\(y^{(\\lambda )}\\) approaches \\(\\ln (y)\\), from some straightforward calculus arguments. To illustrate the usefulness of transformations, we simulated 500 observations from a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. Appendix A3.2 introduces this distribution (that we will encounter again later in studying the behavior of test statistics). The upper left panel of Figure 1.7 shows the original distribution is heavily skewed to the right. The other panels in Figure 1.7 show the data rescaled using the square root, logarithmic and negative reciprocal transformations. The logarithmic transformation, in the lower left panel, provides the best approximation to symmetry for this example. The negative reciprocal transformation is based on \\(\\lambda =-1\\), and then multiplying the rescaled observations by minus one, so that large observations remain large. Figure 1.7: 500 simulated observations from a chi-square distribution. The upper left panel is based on the original distribution. The upper right corresponds to the square root transform, the lower left to the log transform and the lower right to the negative reciprocal transform.

Collections of statistics are very useful for analysts, decision-makers and everyday consumers for understanding massive amounts of data that represent complex situations. To this point, our focus has been on introducing sensible techniques to summarize variables; techniques that will be used repeatedly thought this text. However, the true usefulness of the discipline of statistics is its ability to say something about the unknown, not merely to summarize information already available. To this end, we need to make some fairly formal assumptions about the manner in which the data are observed. As a science, a strong feature of statistics (as a discipline) is the ability to critique these assumptions and offer improved alternatives in specific situations. It is customary to assume that the data are drawn from a larger population that we are interested in describing. The process of drawing the data is known as the sampling, or data generating, process. We denote this sample as \\(\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\}\\). So that we may critique, and modify, these sampling assumptions, we list them below in detail: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\textbf{Basic Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline 1. ~\\mathrm{E~}y_i=\\mu \\\\ 2. ~\\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\sigma ^{2} \\\\ 3. ~\\{y_i\\} \\text{ are independent} \\\\ 4. ~\\{y_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed}. \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] In this basic set-up, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) serve as parameters that describe the location and scale of the parent population. The goal is to infer something sensible about them based on statistics such as \\(\\overline{y}\\) and \\(s_y^{2}\\). For the third assumption, we assume independence among the draws. In a sampling scheme, this may be guaranteed by taking a simple random sample from a population. The fourth assumption is not required for many statistical inference procedures because central limit theorems provide approximate normality for many statistics of interest. However, a formal justification of some statistics, such as t-statistics, requires this additional assumption. Section 1.9 provides an explicit statement of one version of the central limit theorem, giving conditions under which \\(\\overline{y}\\) is approximately normally distributed. This section also discusses a related result, known as an Edgeworth approximation, that shows that the quality of the normal approximation is better for symmetric parent populations when compared to skewed distributions. How does this discussion apply to the study of regression analysis? After all, so far we have focused only on the simple arithmetic average, \\(\\overline{y}\\). In subsequent chapters, we will emphasize that linear regression is the study of weighted averages; specifically, many regression coefficients can be expressed as weighted averages with appropriately chosen weights. Central limit and Edgeworth approximation theorems are available for weighted averages - these results will ensure approximate normality of regression coefficients. To use normal curve approximations in a regression context, we will often transform variables to achieve approximate symmetry. 1.5 Regression and Sampling Designs Approximating normality will be an important issue in practical applications of linear regression. Parts I and II of this book focus on linear regression, where we will learn basic regression concepts and sampling design. Part III will focus on nonlinear regression, involving binary, count and fat-tailed responses, where the normal is not the most helpful reference distribution. Ideas concerning basic concepts and design will also be used in the nonlinear setting. In regression analysis, we focus on one measurement of interest and call this the dependent variable. Other measurements are used as explanatory variables. A goal is to compare differences in the dependent variable in terms of differences in the explanatory variables. As noted in Section 1.1, regression is used extensively in many scientific fields. Table 1.3 lists alternative terms that you may encounter as you read regression applications. Table 1.3. Terminology for Regression Variables \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline\\hline y-\\text{Variable} &amp; x-\\text{Variable} \\\\\\hline \\text{Outcome of interest} &amp; \\text{Explanatory variable} \\\\ \\text{Dependent variable} &amp; \\text{Independent variable} \\\\ \\text{Endogenous variable} &amp; \\text{Exogenous variable} \\\\ \\text{Response} &amp; \\text{Treatment} \\\\ \\text{Regressand} &amp; \\text{Regressor} \\\\ \\text{Left-hand side variable} &amp; \\text{Right-hand side variable} \\\\ \\text{Explained variable } &amp; \\text{Predictor variable} \\\\ \\text{Output} &amp; \\text{Input} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] In the latter part of the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century, statistics was beginning to make an important impact on the development of experimental science. Experimental sciences often use designed studies, where the data are under the control of an analyst. Designed studies are performed in laboratory settings, where there are tight physical restrictions on every variable that a researcher thinks may be important. Designed studies also occur in larger field experiments, where the mechanisms for control are different than in laboratory settings. Agriculture and medicine use designed studies. Data from a designed study are said to be experimental data. To illustrate, a classic example is to consider the yield of a crop such as corn, where each of several parcels of land (the observations) are assigned various levels of fertilizer. The goal is ascertain the effect of fertilizer (the explanatory variable) on the corn yield (the response variable). Although researchers attempt to make parcels of land as much alike as possible, differences inevitably arise. Agricultural researchers use randomization techniques to assign different levels of fertilizer to each parcel of land. In this way, analysts can explain the variation in corn yields in terms of the variation of fertilizer levels. Through the use of randomization techniques, researchers using designed studies can infer that the treatment has a causal effect on the response. Chapter 6 discusses causality further. Example: Rand Health Insurance Experiment. How are medical care expenditures related to the demand for insurance? Many studies have established a positive relation between the amount spent on medical care and the demand for health insurance. Those in poor health anticipate using more medical services than similarly positioned people in good or fair health and will seek higher levels of health insurance to compensate for these anticipated expenditures. They obtain this additional health insurance by (i) selecting a more generous health insurance plan from an employer, (ii) choosing an employer with a more generous health insurance plan or (iii) paying more for individual health insurance. Thus, it is difficult to disentangle the cause and effect relationship of medical care expenditures and the availability of health insurance. A study reported by Manning et al. (1987) sought to answer this question using a carefully designed experiment. In this study, enrolled households from six cities, between November 1974 and February 1977, were randomly assigned to one of 14 different insurance plans. These plans varied by the cost-sharing elements, the co-insurance rate (the percentage paid on out-of-pocket expenditures which varied by 0, 25, 50 and 95%) as well as the deductible (5, 10 or 15 percent of family income, up to a maximum of $1,000). Thus, there was a random assignment to levels of the treatment, the amount of health insurance. The study found that more favorable plans resulted in greater total expenditures, even after controlling for participants’ health status. For actuarial science and other social sciences, designed studies are the exception rather than the rule. For example, if we want to study the effects of smoking on mortality, it is highly unlikely that we could get study participants to agree to be randomly assigned to smoker/nonsmoker groups for several years just so that we could observe their mortality patterns! As with the Section 1.1 Galton study, social science researchers generally work with observational data. Observational data are not under control of the analyst. With observational data, we can not infer causal relationships but we can readily introduce measures of association. To illustrate, in the Galton data, it is apparent that ‘tall’ parents are likely to have ‘tall’ children and conversely ‘short’ parents are likely to have ‘short’ children. Chapter 2 will introduce a correlation and other measures of association. However, we can not infer causality from the data. For example, there may be another variable, such as family diet, that is related to both variables. Good diet in the family could be associated with tall heights of parents and adult children, whereas poor diet stifles growth. If this were the case, we would call family diet a confounding variable. In designed experiments such as the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, we can control for the effects of variables such as health status through random assignment methods. In observational studies, we use statistical control, rather than experimental control. To illustrate, for the Galton data, we might split our observations into two groups, one for ‘good family diet’ and one for ‘poor family diet,’ and examine the relationship between parents’ and children’s height for each subgroup. This is the essence of the regression method, to compare a \\(y\\) and an \\(x\\), ‘controlling for’ the effects of other explanatory variables. Of course, to use statistical control and regression methods, one must record family diet, and any other measures of height that may confound the effects of parents’ height on the height of their adult child. The difficulty in designing studies is trying to imagine all of the variables that could possibly affect a response variable, an impossible task in most social science problems of interest. To give some guidance on when ‘enough is enough,’ Chapter 6 will discuss measures of an explanatory variable’s importance and its impact on model selection. 1.6 Actuarial Applications of Regression This book introduces a statistical method, regression analysis. The introduction is organized around the traditional triad of statistical inference: hypothesis testing, estimation and prediction. Further, this book shows how this methodology can be used in applications that are likely to be of interest to actuaries and to other risk analysts. As such, it is helpful to begin with the three traditional areas of actuarial applications: pricing, reserving and solvency testing. Pricing and adverse selection. Regression analysis can be used to determine insurance prices for many lines of business. For example, in private passenger automobile insurance, expected claims vary by the insured’s gender, age, location (city versus rural), vehicle purpose (work or pleasure) and a host of other explanatory variables. Regression can be used to identify the variables that are important determinants of expected claims. In competitive markets, insurance companies do not use the same price for all insureds. If they did, ‘good risks,’ those with lower than average expected claims, would overpay and leave the company. In contrast, ‘bad risks,’ those with higher than average expected claims, would remain with the company. If the company continued this flat rate pricing policy, premiums would rise (to compensate for claims by the increasing share of bad risks) and market share would dwindle as the company loses good risks. This problem is known as ‘adverse selection.’ Using an appropriate set of explanatory variables, classification systems can be developed so that each insured pays their fair share. Reserving and solvency testing. Both reserving and solvency testing are concerned with predicting whether liabilities associated with a group of policies will exceed the capital devoted to meeting obligations arising from the policies. Reserving involves determining the appropriate amount of capital to meet these obligations. Solvency testing is about assessing the adequacy of capital to fund the obligations for a block of business. In some practice areas, regression can be used to forecast future obligations to help determine reserves (see, for example, Chapter 19). Regression can also be used to compare characteristics of healthy and financially distressed firms for solvency testing (see, for example, Chapter 14). Other risk management applications. Regression analysis is a quantitative tool that can be applied in a broad variety of business problems, not just the traditional areas of pricing, reserving and solvency testing. By becoming familiar with regression analysis, actuaries will have another quantitative skill that can be brought to bear on general problems involving the financial security of people, companies and governmental organizations. To help you develop insights, this book provides many examples of potential ‘non-actuarial’ applications through featured vignettes labeled as ‘examples’ and illustrative data sets. To help understand potential regression applications, start by reviewing the several data sets featured in the Chapter 1 Exercises. Even if you do not complete the exercises to strengthen your data summary skills (that require the use of a computer), a review of the problem descriptions will help you become more familiar with types of applications in which an actuary might use regression techniques. 1.7 Further Reading and References This book introduces regression and time series tools that are most relevant to actuaries and other financial risk analysts. Fortunately, there are other sources that provide excellent introductions to these statistical topics (although not from a risk management viewpoint). Particularly for analysts that intend to specialize in statistics, it is helpful to get another perspective. For regression, I recommend Weisburg (2005) and Faraway (2005). For time series, Diebold (2004) is a good source. Moreover, Klugman, Panjer and Willmot (2008) provides a good introduction to actuarial applications of statistics; this book is intended to complement the Klugman et al. book by focusing on regression and time series methods.

This exercise considers data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), conducted by the U.S. Agency of Health Research and Quality. MEPS is a probability survey that provides nationally representative estimates of health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian population. This survey collects detailed information on individuals of each medical care episode by type of services including physician office visits, hospital emergency room visits, hospital outpatient visits, hospital inpatient stays, all other medical provider visits, and use of prescribed medicines. This detailed information allows one to develop models of health care utilization to predict future expenditures. You can learn more about MEPS at http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/. We consider MEPS data from the panels 7 and 8 of 2003 that consists of 18,735 individuals between ages 18 and 65. From this sample, we took a random sample of 2,000 individuals that appear in the file ‘HealthExpend’. From this sample, there are 157 individuals that had positive inpatient expenditures. There are also 1,352 that had positive outpatient expenditures. We will analyze these two samples separately. Our dependent variables consist of amounts of expenditures for inpatient (EXPENDIP) and outpatient (EXPENDOP) visits. For MEPS, outpatient events include hospital outpatient department visits, office-based provider visits and emergency room visits excluding dental services. (Dental services, compared to other types of health care services, are more predictable and occur in a more regular basis.) Hospital stays with the same date of admission and discharge, known as ‘zero-night stays,’ were included in outpatient counts and expenditures. (Payments associated with emergency room visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay were included in the inpatient expenditures. Prescribed medicines that can be linked to hospital admissions were included in inpatient expenditures, not in outpatient utilization.) Part 1: Use only the 157 individuals that had positive inpatient expenditures and do the following analysis. Compute descriptive statistics for inpatient (EXPENDIP) expenditures. a(i). What is the typical (mean and median) expenditure? a(ii). How does the standard deviation compare to the mean? Do the data appear to be skewed? Compute a box plot, histogram and a (normal) \\(qq\\) plot for EXPENDIP. Comment on the shape of the distribution. Transformations. c(i). Take a square root transform of inpatient expenditures. Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? c(ii). Take a (natural) logarithmic transformation of inpatient expenditures. Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Part 2: Use only the 1,352 individuals that had positive outpatient expenditures. Repeat part (a) and compute histograms for expenditures and logarithmic expenditures. Comment on the approximate normality for each histogram. 1.2 Nursing Home Utilization. This exercise considers nursing home data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS). The State of Wisconsin Medicaid program funds nursing home care for individuals qualifying on the basis of need and financial status. As part of the conditions for participation, Medicaid-certified nursing homes must file an annual cost report to DHFS, summarizing the volume and cost of care provided to all of its residents, Medicaid-funded and otherwise. These cost reports are audited by DHFS staff and form the basis for facility-specific Medicaid daily payment rates for subsequent periods. The data are publicly available; see for more information. The DHFS is interested in predictive techniques that provide reliable utilization forecasts to update their Medicaid funding rate schedule of nursing facilities. In this assignment, we consider the data in the file ‘WiscNursingHome’ in cost report years 2000 and 2001. There are 362 facilities in 2000 and 355 facilities in 2001. Typically, utilization of nursing home care is measured in patient days (‘patient days’ is the number of days each patient was in the facility, summed over all patients). For this exercise, we define the outcome variable to be total patient years (TPY), the number of total patient days in the cost reporting period divided by number of facility operating days in the cost reporting period (see Rosenberg et al., 2007, Appendix 1, for further discussion of this choice). The number of beds (NUMBED) and square footage (SQRFOOT) of the nursing home both measure the size of the facility. Not surprisingly, these continuous variables will be important predictors of TPY. Part 1: Use cost report year 2000 data, and do the following analysis. Compute descriptive statistics for TPY, NUMBED, and SQRFOOT. Summarize the distribution of TPY using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Transformations. Take a (natural) logarithmic transformation of TPY (LOGTPY). Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Part 2: Use cost report year 2001 data and repeat parts (a) and (c). 1.3 Automobile Insurance Claims. As an actuarial analyst, you are working with a large insurance company to help them understand their claims distribution for their private passenger automobile policies. You have available claims data for a recent year, consisting of: STATE CODE: codes 01 through 17 used, with each code randomly assigned to an actual individual state CLASS: rating class of operator, based on age, gender, marital status and use of vehicle GENDER: operator gender AGE: operator age PAID: amount paid to settle and close a claim. You are focusing on older drivers, 50 and higher, for which there are \\(n = 6,773\\) claims available. Examine the histogram of the amount PAID and comment on the symmetry. Create a new variable, the (natural) logarithmic claims paid, LNPAID. Create a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot of LNPAID. Comment on the symmetry of this variable. 1.4 Hospital Costs. Suppose that you are an employee benefits actuary working with a medium size company in Wisconsin. This company is considering offering, for the first time in their industry, hospital insurance coverage to dependent children of their employees. You have access to company records and so have available the number, age and gender of the dependent children but have no other information about hospital costs from the company. In particular, no firm in this industry has offered this coverage and so you have little historical industry experience upon which you can forecast expected claims. You gather data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (NIS-HCUP), a nationwide survey of hospital costs conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). You restrict consideration to Wisconsin hospitals and analyze a random sample of \\(n=500\\) claims from 2003 data. Although the data comes from hospital records, it is organized by individual discharge and so you have information about the age and gender of the patient discharged. Specifically, you consider patients aged 0-17 years. In a separate project, you will consider the frequency of hospitalization. For this project, the goal is to model the severity of hospital charges, by age and gender. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, TOTCHG. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and call the new variable LNTOTCHG. Examine the distribution of this transformed variable. To visualize the logarithmic relationship, plot LNTOTCHG versus TOTCHG. 1.5 Automobile injury insurance claims. We consider automobile injury claims data using data from the Insurance Research Council (IRC), a division of the American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters and the Insurance Institute of America. The data, collected in 2002, contains information on demographic information about the claimant, attorney involvement and the economic loss (LOSS, in thousands), among other variables. We consider here a sample of \\(n=1,340\\) losses from a single state. The full 2002 study contains over 70,000 closed claims based on data from thirty-two insurers. The IRC conducted similar studies in 1977, 1987, 1992 and 1997. Compute descriptive statistics for the total economic loss (LOSS). What is the typical loss? Compute a histogram and (normal) \\(qq\\) plot for LOSS. Comment on the shape of the distribution. Partition the data set into two subsamples, one corresponding to those claims that involved an ATTORNEY (=1) and the other where an ATTORNEY was not involved (=2). c(i). For each subsample, compute the typical loss. Does there appear to be a difference in the typical losses by attorney involvement? c(ii) To compare the distributions, compute a boxplot by level of attorney involvement. c(iii). For each subsample, compute a histogram and \\(qq\\) plot. Compare the two distributions to one another. 1.6 Insurance Company Expenses. Like other businesses, insurance companies seek to minimize expenses associated with doing business in order to enhance profitability. To study expenses, this exercise examines a random sample of 500 insurance companies from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) database of over 3,000 companies. The NAIC maintains one of the world’s largest insurance regulatory databases; we consider here data that are based on 2005 annual reports for all the property and casualty insurance companies in the United States. The annual reports are financial statements that use statutory accounting principles. Specifically, our dependent variable is EXPENSES, the non-claim expenses for a company. Although not needed for this exercise, non-claim expenses are based on three components: unallocated loss adjustment, underwriting and investment expenses. The unallocated loss adjustment expense is the expense not directly attributable to a claim but is indirectly associated with settling claims; it includes items such as the salaries of claims adjusters, legal fees, court costs, expert witnesses and investigation costs. Underwriting expenses consists of policy acquisition costs, such as commissions, as well as the portion of administrative, general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations. Investment expense are those expenses related to investment activities of the insurer. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, EXPENSES. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and examine the distribution of this transformed variable. Has the transformation helped to symmetrize the distribution? 1.7 National Life Expectancies. Who is doing health care right? Health care decisions are made at the individual, corporate and government levels. Virtually every person, corporation and government have their own perspective on health care; these different perspectives result in a wide variety of systems for managing health care. Comparing different health care systems help us learn about approaches other than our own, which in turn help us make better decisions in designing improved systems. Here, we consider health care systems from \\(n=185\\) countries throughout the world. As a measure of the quality of care, we use LIFEEXP, the life expectancy at birth. This dependent variable, with several explanatory variables, are listed in Table 1.4. From this table, you will note that although there are 185 countries consider in this study, not all countries provided information for each variable. Data not available are noted under the column Num Miss. The data are from the United Nations (UN) Human Development Report. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, LIFEEXP. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and examine the distribution of this transformed variable. Has the transformation helped to symmetrize the distribution? Table 1.4.

Thus, it is helpful to provide an explicit statement of one version of the central limit theorem. Central Limit Theorem. Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are independently distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\), finite variance \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}|y|^{3}\\) is finite. Then, \\[ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }\\Pr \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma }(\\overline{y} -\\mu )\\leq x\\right) =\\Phi \\left( x\\right) , \\] for each \\(x,\\) where \\(\\Phi \\left( .\\right)\\) is the standard normal distribution function. Under the assumptions of this theorem, the re-scaled distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) approaches a standard normal as the sample size, \\(n\\), increases. We interpret this as meaning that, for ‘large’ sample sizes, the distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) may be approximated by a normal distribution. Empirical investigations have shown that sample sizes of \\(n=25\\) through 50 provide adequate approximations for most purposes. When does the central limit theorem not work well? Some insights are provided by another result from mathematical statistics. Edgeworth Approximation. Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots, y_n\\) are identically and independently distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\), finite variance \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}|y|^{3}\\) is finite. Then,% \\[ \\Pr \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma }(\\overline{y}-\\mu )\\leq x\\right) =\\Phi \\left( x\\right) +\\frac{1}{6}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi }}e^{-x^{2}/2}\\frac{\\mathrm{E }(y-\\mu )^{3}}{\\sigma ^{3}\\sqrt{n}}+\\frac{h_n}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\] for each \\(x,\\) where \\(h_n\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty .\\) This result suggests that the distribution of \\(\\bar{y}\\) becomes closer to a normal distribution as the skewness, \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\overline{y} -\\mu )^{3}\\), becomes closer to zero. This is important in insurance applications because many distributions tend to be skewed. Historically, analysts used the second term on the right-hand side of the result to provide a ‘correction’ for the normal curve approximation. See, for example, Beard, Pentik\"{a}inen and Pesonen (1984) for further discussion of Edgeworth approximations in actuarial science. An alternative (used in this book) that we saw in Section 1.3 is to transform the data, thus achieving approximate symmetry. As suggested by the Edgeworth approximation theorem, if our parent population is close to symmetric, then the distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) will be approximately normal.

This chapter considers regression in the case of only one explanatory variable. Despite this seeming simplicity, most of the deep ideas of regression can be developed in this framework. By limiting ourselves to the one variable case, we are able to express many calculations using simple algebra. This will allow us to develop our intuition about regression techniques by reinforcing it with simple demonstrations. Further, we can illustrate the relationships between two variables graphically because we are working in only two dimensions. Graphical tools prove to be important for developing a link between the data and a model. 2.1 Correlations and Least Squares Regression is about relationships. Specifically, we will study how two variables, an \\(x\\) and a \\(y\\), are related. We want to be able to answer questions such as, if we change the level of \\(x\\), what will happen to the level of \\(y\\)? If we compare two “subjects” that appear similar except for the \\(x\\) measurement, how will their \\(y\\) measurements differ? Understanding relationships among variables is critical for quantitative management, particularly in actuarial science where uncertainty is so prevalent. It is helpful to work with a specific example to become familiar with key concepts. Analysis of lottery sales has not been part of traditional actuarial practice but it is a growth area in which actuaries could contribute. Example: Wisconsin Lottery Sales. State of Wisconsin lottery administrators are interested in assessing factors that affect lottery sales. Sales consists of online lottery tickets that are sold by selected retail establishments in Wisconsin. These tickets are generally priced at $1.00, so the number of tickets sold equals the lottery revenue. We analyze average lottery sales (SALES) over a forty-week period, April, 1998 through January, 1999, from fifty randomly selected areas identified by postal (ZIP) code within the state of Wisconsin. Although many economic and demographic variables might influence sales, our first analysis focuses on population (POP) as a key determinant. Chapter 3 will show how to consider additional explanatory variables. Intuitively, it seems clear that geographic areas with more people will have higher sales. So, other things being equal, a larger \\(x=POP\\) means a larger \\(y=SALES.\\) However, the lottery is an important source of revenue for the state and we want to be as precise as possible. A little additional notation will be useful subsequently. In this sample, there are fifty geographic areas and we use subscripts to identify each area. For example, \\(y_1\\) = 1,285.4 represents sales for the first area in the sample that has population \\(x_1\\) = 435. Call the ordered pair (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)) = (435, 1285.4) the first observation. Extending this notation, the entire sample containing fifty observations may be represented by (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)), …, (\\(x_{50}\\), \\(y_{50}\\)). The ellipses ( … ) mean that the pattern is continued until the final object is encountered. We will often speak of a generic member of the sample, referring to (\\(x_i\\), \\(y_i\\)) as the \\(i\\)th observation. Data sets can get complicated, so it will help if you begin by working with each variable separately. The two panels in Figure 2.1 show histograms that give a quick visual impression of the distribution of each variable in isolation of the other. Table 2.1 provides corresponding numerical summaries. To illustrate, for the population variable (POP), we see that the area with the smallest number contained 280 people whereas the largest contained 39,098. The average, over 50 ZIP codes, was 9,311.04. For our second variable, sales were as low as 189 and as high as 33,181. Figure 2.1: Histograms of Population and Sales. Each distribution is skewed to the right, indicating that there are many small areas compared to a few areas with larger sales and populations.

After we understand the information in each variable in isolation of the other, we can begin exploring the relationship between the two variables. Scatter Plot and Correlation Coefficients - Basic Summary Tools The basic graphical tool used to investigate the relationship between the two variables is a scatter plot such as in Figure 2.2. Although we may lose the exact values of the observations when graphing data, we gain a visual impression of the relationship between population and sales. From Figure 2.2 we see that areas with larger populations tend to purchase more lottery tickets. How strong is this relationship? Can knowledge of the area’s population help us anticipate the revenue from lottery sales? We explore these two questions below. Figure 2.2: A scatter plot of the lottery data. Each of the 50 plotting symbols corresponds to a zip code in the study. This figure suggests that postal areas with larger populations have larger lottery revenues. R Code to Produce Figure 2.2 #Lot &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CSVData/WiscLottery.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) # FIGURE 2.2, WITH CORRELATIONS par(mar=c(4.1,3.8,2,1),cex=1.1) plot(Lot$POP, Lot$SALES, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1, xlab = &quot;POP&quot;) mtext(&quot;SALES&quot;,side=2, at=36000, las=1, cex=1.1) One way to summarize the strength of the relationship between two variables is through a correlation statistic. Definition. The ordinary, or Pearson, correlation coefficient is defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} r=\\frac{1}{(n-1)s_xs_y}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x}\\right) \\left( y_{i}-\\overline{y}\\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Here, we use the sample standard deviation \\(s_y = \\sqrt{(n-1)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\overline{y}\\right)^{2}}\\) defined in Section 1.2, with similar notation for \\(s_x\\). Although there are other correlation statistics, the correlation coefficient devised by Pearson (1895) has several desirable properties. One important property is that, for any data set, \\(r\\) is bounded by -1 and 1, that is, \\(-1\\leq r\\leq 1\\). (Exercise 2A.9 provides steps for you to check this property.) If \\(r\\) is greater than zero, the variables are said to be (positively) correlated. If \\(r\\) is less than zero, the variables are said to be negatively correlated. The larger the coefficient is in absolute value, the stronger is the relationship. In fact, if \\(r=1\\), then the variables are perfectly correlated. In this case, all of the data lie on a straight line that goes through the lower left and upper right-hand quadrants. If \\(r=-1\\), then all of the data lie on a line that goes through the upper left and lower right-hand quadrants. The coefficient \\(r\\) is a measure of a linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient is said to be location and scale invariant. Thus, each variable’s center of location does not matter in the calculation of \\(r\\). For example, if we add $100 to the sales of each zip code, each \\(y_i\\) will increase by 100. However, \\(\\overline{y}\\), the average purchase price will also increase by 100 so that the deviation \\(y_i - \\overline{y}\\) remains unchanged, or invariant. Further, the scale of each variable does not matter in the calculation of \\(r\\). For example, suppose we divide each population by 1000 so that \\(x_i\\) now represents population in thousands. Thus, \\(\\overline{x}\\) is also divided by 1000 and you should check that \\(s_x\\) is also divided by 1000. Thus, the standardized version of \\(x_i\\), \\(\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) /s_x\\), remains unchanged, or invariant. Many statistical packages compute a standardized version of a variable by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation. Now, let’s use \\(y_{i,std}=\\left( y_i- \\overline{y}\\right) /s_y\\) and \\(x_{i,std}=\\left( x_i-\\overline{x} \\right) /s_x\\) to be the standardized versions of \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_i\\), respectively. With this notation, we can express the correlation coefficient as \\(r=(n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i,std}\\times y_{i,std}.\\) The correlation coefficient is said to be a dimensionless measure. This is because we have taken away dollars, and all other units of measures, by considering the standardized variables \\(x_{i,std}\\) and \\(y_{i,std}\\). Because the correlation coefficient does not depend on units of measure, it is a statistic that can readily be compared across different data sets. In the world of business, the term “correlation” is often used as synonymous with the term “relationship.” For the purposes of this text, we use the term correlation when referring only to linear relationships. The classic nonlinear relationship is \\(y=x^{2}\\), a quadratic relationship. Consider this relationship and the fictitious data set for \\(x\\), \\(\\{-2,1,0,1,2\\}\\). Now, as an exercise (2.2), produce a rough graph of the data set: \\[ \\begin{array}{l|rrrrr} \\hline i &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\hline x_i &amp; -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ y_i &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] The correlation coefficient for this data set turns out to be \\(r=0\\) (check this). Thus, despite the fact that there is a perfect relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (\\(=x^{2}\\)), there is a zero correlation. Recall that location and scale changes are not relevant in correlation discussions, so we could easily change the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be more representative of a business data set. How strong is the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) for the lottery data? Graphically, the response is a scatter plot, as in Figure 2.2. Numerically, the main response is the correlation coefficient which turns out to be \\(r\\) = 0.886 for this data set. We interpret this statistic by saying that SALES and POP are (positively) correlated. The strength of the relationship is strong because \\(r\\) = 0.886 is close to one. In summary, we may describe this relationship by saying that there is a strong correlation between SALES and POP. Method of Least Squares Now we begin to explore the question, “Can knowledge of population help us understand sales?” To respond to this question, we identify sales as the response, or dependent, variable. The population variable, which is used to help understand sales, is called the explanatory, or independent, variable. Suppose that we have available the sample data of fifty sales \\(\\{y_1, \\ldots, y_{50} \\}\\) and your job is to predict the sales of a randomly selected ZIP code. Without knowledge of the population variable, a sensible predictor is simply \\(\\overline{y}=6,495\\), the average of the available sample. Naturally, you anticipate that areas with larger populations will have larger sales. That is, if you also have knowledge of population, then can this estimate be improved? If so, then by how much? To answer these questions, the first step assumes an approximate linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). To fit a line to our data set, we use the method of least squares. We need a general technique so that, if different analysts agree on the data and agree on the fitting technique, then they will agree on the line. If different analysts fit a data set using eyeball approximations, in general they will arrive at different lines, even using the same data set. The method begins with the line \\(y=b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x\\), where the intercept and slope, \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\), are merely generic values. For the \\(i\\)th observation, $y_i-( b_0{}+b_1{}x_i) $ represents the deviation of the observed value \\(y_i\\) from the line at \\(x_i\\). The quantity \\[\\begin{equation*} SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) ^{2} \\end{equation*}\\] represents the sum of squared deviations for this candidate line. The least squares method consists of determining the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\) that minimize \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})\\). This is an easy problem that can be solved by calculus, as follows. Taking partial derivatives with respect to each argument yields \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_0^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-2)\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_1^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-2x_i)\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] The reader is invited to take second partial derivatives to ensure that we are minimizing, not maximizing, this function. Setting these quantities equal to zero  and canceling constant terms yields \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) =0 \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) =0, \\end{equation*}\\] which are known as the normal equations. Solving these equations yields the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\) that minimize the sum of squares, as follows. Definition. The least squares intercept and slope estimates are \\[\\begin{equation*} b_1=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}~~~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~~~b_0=\\overline{y}-b_1 \\overline{x}. \\end{equation*}\\] The line that they determine, \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\), is called the fitted regression line. We have dropped the asterisk, or star, notation because \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are no longer “candidate” values. Does this procedure yield a sensible line for our Wisconsin lottery sales? Earlier, we computed \\(r=0.886\\). From this and the basic summary statistics in Table 2.1, we have \\(b_1 = 0.886 \\left( 8,103\\right) /11,098=0.647\\) and \\(b_0 = 6,495-(0.647)9,311 = 469.7.\\) This yields the fitted regression line \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{y} = 469.7 + (0.647)x. \\end{equation*}\\] The carat, or “hat,” on top of the \\(y\\) reminds us that this \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or \\(\\widehat{SALES}\\), is a fitted value. One application of the regression line is to estimate sales for a specific population say, \\(x=10,000\\). The estimate is the height of the regression line, which is \\(469.7 + (0.647)(10,000) = 6,939.7\\). Example: Summarizing Simulations. Regression analysis is a tool for summarizing complex data. In practical work, actuaries often simulate complicated financial scenarios; it is often overlooked that regression can be used to summarize relationships of interest. To illustrate, Manistre and Hancock (2005) simulated many realizations of a 10-year European put option and demonstrated the relationship between two actuarial risk measures, the value-at-risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE). For one example, these authors examined lognormally distributed stock returns with an initial stock price of $100, so that in 10 years the price of the stock would be distributed as \\[\\begin{equation*} S(Z)=100 \\exp \\left( (.08) 10 + .15 \\sqrt{10} Z \\right), \\end{equation*}\\] based on an annual mean return of 10%, standard deviation 15% and the outcome from a standard normal random variable \\(Z\\). The put option pays the difference between the strike price, that will be taken to be 110 for this example, and \\(S(Z)\\). The present value of this option is \\[\\begin{equation*} C(Z)= \\mathrm{e}^{-0.06(10)} \\mathrm{max} \\left(0, 110-S(Z) \\right), \\end{equation*}\\] based on a 6% discount rate. To estimate the VaR and CTE, for each \\(i\\), 1000 i.i.d. standard normal random variables were simulated and used to calculate 1000 present values, \\(C_{i1}, \\ldots, C_{i,1000}.\\) The 95th percentile of these present values is the estimate of the value at risk, denoted as \\(VaR_i.\\) The average of the highest 50 (\\(= (1-.05) \\times 1000\\)) of the present values is the estimate of the conditional tail expectation, denoted as \\(CTE_i\\). Manistre and Hancock (2005) performed this calculation \\(i=1, \\ldots, 1000\\) times; the result is presented in Figure 2.3. The scatterplot shows a strong but not perfect relationship between the \\(VaR\\) and the \\(CTE\\), the correlation coefficient turns out to be \\(r=0.782\\).

To infer general relationships, we need models to represent outcomes of broad populations. This chapter focuses on a “basic linear regression” model. The “linear regression” part comes from the fact that we fit a line to the data. The “basic” part is because we use only one explanatory variable, \\(x\\). This model is also known as a “simple” linear regression. This text avoids this language because it gives the false impression that regression ideas and interpretations with one explanatory variable are always straightforward. We now introduce two sets of assumptions of the basic model, the “observables” and the “error” representations. They are equivalent but each will help us as we later extend regression models beyond the basics. \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\hline &amp;\\textbf{Basic Linear Regression Model} \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{Observables Representation Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline \\text{F1}. &amp; \\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i . \\\\ \\text{F2}. &amp; \\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\} \\text{ are non-stochastic variables}. \\\\ \\text{F3}. &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma ^{2}. \\\\ \\text{F4}. &amp; \\{ y_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables}. \\\\ \\hline\\ \\end{array} } \\] The “observables representation” focuses on variables that we can see (or observe), \\((x_i,y_i)\\). Inference about the distribution of \\(y\\) is conditional on the observed explanatory variables, so that we may treat \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) as non-stochastic variables (assumption F2). When considering types of sampling mechanisms for \\((x_i,y_i)\\), it is convenient to think of a stratified random sampling scheme, where values of \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) are treated as the strata, or group. Under stratified sampling, for each unique value of \\(x_i\\), we draw a random sample from a population. To illustrate, suppose you are drawing from a database of firms to understand stock return performance (\\(y\\)) and wish to stratify based on the size of the firm. If the amount of assets is a continuous variable, then we can imagine drawing a sample of size 1 for each firm. In this way, we hypothesize a distribution of stock returns conditional on firm asset size. Digression: You will often see reports that summarize results for the “top 50 managers” or the “best 100 universities,” measured by some outcome variable. In regression applications, make sure that you do not select observations based on a dependent variable, such as the highest stock return, because this is stratifying based on the \\(y\\), not the \\(x\\). Chapter 6 will discuss sampling procedures in greater detail. Stratified sampling also provides motivation for assumption F4, the independence among responses. One can motivate assumption F1 by thinking of \\((x_i,y_i)\\) as a draw from a population, where the mean of the conditional distribution of \\(y_i\\) given {\\(x_i\\)} is linear in the explanatory variable. Assumption F3 is known as homoscedasticity that we will discuss extensively in Section 5.7. See Goldberger (1991) for additional background on this representation. A fifth assumption that is often implicitly used is: This assumption is not required for many statistical inference procedures because central limit theorems provide approximate normality for many statistics of interest. However, formal justification for some, such as \\(t\\)-statistics, do require this additional assumption. In contrast to the observables representation, an alternative set of assumptions focuses on the deviations, or “errors,” in the regression, defined as \\(\\varepsilon_i=y_i-\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i \\right)\\). \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\hline &amp;\\textbf{Basic Linear Regression Model} \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{Error Representation Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline \\text{E1}. &amp; y_i=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i . \\\\ \\text{E2}. &amp; \\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\} \\text{ are non-stochastic variables}. \\\\ \\text{E3}. &amp; \\mathrm{E}~\\varepsilon _i=0 \\text{ and } \\mathrm{Var}~\\varepsilon _i=\\sigma ^{2}. \\\\ \\text{E4}. &amp; \\{ \\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables}. \\\\ \\hline\\ \\end{array} } \\] The “error representation” is based on the Gaussian theory of errors (see Stigler, 1986, for a historical background). Assumption E1 assumes that \\(y\\) is in part due to a linear function of the observed explanatory variable, \\(x\\). Other unobserved variables that influence the measurement of \\(y\\) are interpreted to be included in the “error” term \\(\\varepsilon _i\\), which is also known as the “disturbance” term. The independence of errors, E4, can be motivated by assuming that {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are realized through a simple random sample from an unknown population of errors. Assumptions E1-E4 are equivalent to F1-F4. The error representation provides a useful springboard for motivating goodness of fit measures (Section 2.3). However, a drawback of the error representation is that it draws the attention from the observable quantities \\((x_i,y_i)\\) to an unobservable quantity, {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)}. To illustrate, the sampling basis, viewing {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} as a simple random sample, is not directly verifiable because one cannot directly observe the sample {$ _i$}. Moreover, the assumption of additive errors in E1 will be troublesome when we consider nonlinear regression models. Figure 2.4 illustrates some of the assumptions of the basic linear regression model. The data (\\(x_1,y_1\\)), (\\(x_2,y_2\\)) and (\\(x_3,y_3\\)) are observed and are represented by the circular opaque plotting symbols. According to the model, these observations should be close to the regression line \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Each deviation from the line is random. We will often assume that the distribution of deviations may be represented by a normal curve, as in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: The distribution of the response varies by the level of the explanatory variable. The basic linear regression model assumptions describe the underlying population. Table 2.2 highlights the idea that characteristics of this population can be summarized by the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). In Section 2.1, we summarized data from a sample, introducing the statistics \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). Section 2.3 will introduce \\(s^{2}\\), the statistic corresponding to the parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). Table 2.2.

Some Basic Summary Measures Although statistics is the science of summarizing data, it is also the art of arguing with data. This section develops some of the basic tools used to justify the basic linear regression model. A scatter plot may provide strong visual evidence that \\(x\\) influences \\(y\\); developing numerical evidence will enable us to quantify the strength of the relationship. Further, numerical evidence will be useful when we consider other data sets where the graphical evidence is not compelling. 2.3.1 Partitioning the Variability The squared deviations, \\(\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2\\), provide a basis for measuring the spread of the data. If we wish to estimate the \\(i\\)th dependent variable without knowledge of \\(x\\), then \\(\\overline{y}\\) is an appropriate estimate and \\(y_i- \\overline{y}\\) represents the deviation of the estimate. We use \\(Total~SS=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2\\), the total sum of squares, to represent the variation in all of the responses. Suppose now that we also have knowledge of \\(x\\), an explanatory variable. Using the fitted regression line, for each observation we can compute the corresponding fitted value, \\(\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_i\\). The fitted value is our estimate with knowledge of the explanatory variable. As before, the difference between the response and the fitted value, \\(y_i- \\widehat{y}_i\\), represents the deviation of this estimate. We now have two “estimates” of \\(y_i\\), these are \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) and \\(\\overline{y}\\). Presumably, if the regression line is useful, then $ _i$ is a more accurate measure than \\(\\overline{y}\\). To judge this usefulness, we algebraically decompose the total deviation as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\underbrace{y_i-\\overline{y}} &amp; = &amp; \\underbrace{y_i-\\widehat{y}_i} &amp; + &amp; \\underbrace{\\widehat{y}_i-\\overline{y}} \\\\ \\text{total} &amp; = &amp; \\text{unexplained} &amp; + &amp; \\text{explained} \\\\ \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} \\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Interpret this equation as “the deviation without knowledge of \\(x\\) equals the deviation with knowledge of \\(x\\) plus the deviation explained by \\(x\\).” Figure 2.5 is a geometric display of this decomposition. In the figure, an observation above the line was chosen, yielding a positive deviation from the fitted regression line, to make the graph easier to read. A good exercise is to draw a rough sketch corresponding to Figure 2.5 with an observation below the fitted regression line. Figure 2.5: Geometric display of the deviation decomposition. Now, from the algebraic decomposition in equation (2.1), square each side of the equation and sum over all observations. After a little algebraic manipulation, this yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) ^2+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\widehat{y}_i- \\overline{y}\\right) ^2. \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] We rewrite this as \\(Total~SS=Error~SS+Regression~SS\\) where \\(SS\\) stands for sum of squares. We interpret: \\(Total~SS\\) as the total variation without knowledge of \\(x\\), \\(Error~SS\\) as the total variation remaining after the introduction of \\(x\\), and \\(Regression~SS\\) as the difference between the \\(Total~SS\\) and \\(Error~SS\\) , or the total variation “explained” through knowledge of \\(x\\). When squaring the right-hand side of equation (2.1), we have the cross-product term \\(2\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) \\left( \\widehat{y}_i-\\overline{y}\\right)\\). With the “algebraic manipulation,” one can check that the sum of the cross-products over all observations is zero. This result is not true for all fitted lines but is a special property of the least squares fitted line. In many instances, the variability decomposition is reported through only a single statistic. Definition. The coefficient of determination is denoted by the symbol \\(R^2\\), called “\\(R\\)-square, and defined as \\[\\begin{equation*} R^2=\\frac{Regression~SS}{Total~SS}. \\end{equation*}\\] We interpret \\(R^2\\) to be the proportion of variability explained by the regression line. In one extreme case where the regression line fits the data perfectly, we have \\(Error~SS=0\\) and \\(R^2=1\\). In the other extreme case where the regression line provides no information about the response, we have \\(Regression~SS=0\\) and \\(R^2=0.\\) The coefficient of determination is constrained by the inequalities \\(0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\) with larger values implying a better fit. 2.3.2 The Size of a Typical Deviation: s In the basic linear regression model, the deviation of the response from the regression line, $y_i-( _0+_1x_i) $, is not an observable quantity because the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)  are not observed. However, by using estimators \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), we can approximate this deviation using \\[\\begin{equation*} e_i=y_i-\\widehat{y}_i=y_i-\\left( b_0+b_1x_i\\right) , \\end{equation*}\\] known as the residual. Residuals will be critical to developing strategies for improving model specification in Section 2.6. We now show how to use the residuals to estimate \\(\\sigma ^2\\). From a first course in statistics, we know that if one could observe the deviations \\(\\varepsilon _i\\), then a desirable estimate of \\(\\sigma ^2\\) would be \\((n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\varepsilon _i-\\overline{\\varepsilon }\\right) ^2\\). Because {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are not observed, we use the following. Definition. An estimator of \\(\\sigma ^2\\), the mean square error (MSE), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} s^2=\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i{}^2. \\label{BLRs2} \\end{equation}\\] The positive square root, \\(s=\\sqrt{s^2},\\) is called the residual standard deviation. Comparing the definitions of \\(s^2\\) and \\((n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\varepsilon _i-\\overline{\\varepsilon }\\right) ^2\\), you will see two important differences. First, in defining \\(s^2\\) we have not subtracted the average residual from each residual before squaring. This is because the average residual is zero, a special property of least squares estimation (see Exercise 2.14). This result can be shown using algebra and is guaranteed for all data sets. Second, in defining \\(s^2\\) we have divided by \\(n-2\\) instead of \\(n-1\\). Intuitively, dividing by either \\(n\\) or \\(n-1\\) tends to underestimate \\(\\sigma ^2\\). The reason is that, when fitting lines to data, we need at least two observations to determine a line. For example, we must have at least three observations for there to be any variability about a line. How much “freedom” is there for variability about a line? We will say that the error degrees of freedom is the number of observations available, \\(n\\), minus the number of observations needed to determine a line, 2 (with symbols, \\(df=n-2\\)). However, as we saw in the least squares estimation subsection, we do not need to identify two actual observations to determine a line. The idea is that if an analyst knows the line and \\(n-2\\) observations, then the remaining two observations can be determined, without variability. When dividing by \\(n-2\\), it can be shown that \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma ^2\\). We can also express \\(s^2\\) in terms of the sum of squares quantities. That is, \\[\\begin{equation*} s^2=\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) ^2= \\frac{Error~SS}{n-2}=MSE. \\end{equation*}\\] This leads us to the analysis of variance, or ANOVA, table: \\[ \\begin{array}{llcl} \\hline \\hline \\text{ANOVA Table} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Source} &amp; \\text{Sum of Squares} &amp; df &amp; \\text{Mean Square} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Regression} &amp; Regression~SS &amp; 1 &amp; Regression~MS \\\\ \\text{Error} &amp; Error~SS &amp; n-2 &amp; MSE \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; Total~SS &amp; n-1 &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\] The ANOVA table is merely a bookkeeping device used to keep track of the sources of variability; it routinely appears in statistical software packages as part of the regression output. The mean square column figures are defined to be the sums of square (\\(SS\\)) figures divided by their respective degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)). In particular, the mean square for errors (\\(MSE\\)) equals $ s^2$ and the regression sum of squares equals the regression mean square. This latter property is specific to the regression with one variable case; it is not true where we consider more than one explanatory variable. The error degrees of freedom in the ANOVA table is \\(n-2\\). The total degrees of freedom is \\(n-1\\), reflecting the fact that the total sum of squares is centered about the mean (at least two observations are required for positive variability). The single degree of freedom associated with the regression portion means that the slope, plus one observation, is enough information to determine the line. This is because it takes two observations to determine a line and at least three observations for there to be any variability about the line. The analysis of variance table for the lottery data is: Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square Regression 2,527,165,015 1 2,527,165,015 Error 690,116,755 48 14,377,432 Total 3,217,281,770 49 R Code to Produce Lottery ANOVA Table #Lot &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CSVData/WiscLottery.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) model.basiclinearreg&lt;-lm(Lot$SALES ~ Lot$POP) #summary(model.basiclinearreg) ANOVA &lt;- anova(model.basiclinearreg) row1 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[1], ANOVA$`Df`[1], ANOVA$`Mean Sq`[1]) row2 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[2], ANOVA$`Df`[2], ANOVA$`Mean Sq`[2]) row3 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[1]+ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[2], ANOVA$`Df`[1] +ANOVA$`Df`[2], NaN) ANOVATable &lt;- rbind(row1, row2, row3) ANOVATable1 &lt;- format(round(ANOVATable, digits = 0), big.mark = &#39;,&#39;) ANOVATable1[3,3] &lt;- &quot;&quot; rownames(ANOVATable1) &lt;- c(&quot;Regression&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, &quot;Total&quot;) colnames(ANOVATable1) &lt;- c(&quot;Sum of Squares&quot;, &quot;$df$&quot;, &quot;Mean Square&quot;) kable(ANOVATable1, align = &#39;r&#39;) %&gt;% kable_styling(position = &quot;center&quot;, full_width = FALSE) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_classic(font = 12, html_font = &quot;Cambria&quot;) From this table, you can check that \\(R^2=78.5\\%\\) and \\(s=3,792.\\) 2.4 Properties of Regression Coefficient Estimators The least squares estimates can be expressed as weighted sum of the responses. To see this, define the weights \\[\\begin{equation*} w_i=\\frac{x_i-\\overline{x}}{s_x^2(n-1)}. \\end{equation*}\\] Because the sum of \\(x\\)-deviations (\\(x_i-\\overline{x}\\)) is zero, we see that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i=0\\). Thus, we can express the slope estimate \\[\\begin{equation} b_1=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}=\\frac{1}{(n-1)s_x^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) \\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iy_i. \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] The exercises ask the reader to verify that \\(b_0\\) can also be expressed as a weighted sum of responses, so our discussion pertains to both regression coefficients. Because regression coefficients are weighted sums of responses, they can be affected dramatically by unusual observations (see Section 2.6). Because \\(b_1\\) is a weighted sum, it is straightforward to derive the expectation and variance of this statistic. By the linearity of expectations and Assumption F1, we have \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E}~b_1=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i~\\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i+\\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i=\\beta_1. \\end{equation*}\\] That is, \\(b_1\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\beta_1\\). Here, the sum $ _{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i$ \\(=\\) \\(\\left[ s_x^2(n-1)\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) x_i\\) \\(=\\left[s_x^2(n-1)\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) ^2=1.\\) From the definition of the weights, some easy algebra also shows that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i^2=1/\\left( s_x^2(n-1)\\right)\\). Further, the independence of the responses implies that the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances, and thus we have \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}~b_1 =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i^2\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{s_x^2(n-1)}. \\end{equation*}\\] Replacing \\(\\sigma ^2\\) by its estimator \\(s^2\\) and taking square roots leads to the following. Definition. The standard error of \\(b_1\\), the estimated standard deviation of \\(b_1\\), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} se(b_1)=\\frac{s}{s_x\\sqrt{n-1}}. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] This is our measure of the reliability, or precision, of the slope estimator. Using equation (2.4), we see that \\(se(b_1)\\) is determined by three quantities, \\(n\\), \\(s\\) and \\(s_x\\), as follows: If we have more observations so that \\(n\\) becomes larger, then $ se(b_1)$ becomes smaller, other things equal. If the observations have a greater tendency to lie closer to the line so that \\(s\\) becomes smaller, then \\(se(b_1)\\) becomes smaller, other things equal. If values of the explanatory variable become more spread out so that $ s_x$ increases, then \\(se(b_1)\\) becomes smaller, other things equal. Smaller values of \\(se(b_1)\\) offer a better opportunity to detect relations between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Figure 2.6 illustrates these relationships. Here, the scatter plot in the middle has the smallest value of \\(se(b_1)\\). Compared with the middle plot, the left-hand plot has a larger value of \\(s\\) and thus \\(se(b_1)\\). Compared with the right-hand plot, the middle plot has a larger \\(s_x\\), and thus smaller value of \\(se(b_1)\\). Figure 2.6: These three scatter plots exhibit the same linear relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). The plot on the left exhibits greater variability about the line than the plot in the middle. The plot on the right exhibits a smaller standard deviation in \\(x\\) than the plot in the middle.

That is, recall from mathematical statistics that linear combinations of normal random variables are also normal. Thus, if Assumption F5 holds, then \\(b_1\\) is normally distributed. Moreover, several versions of central limit theorems exists for weighted sums (see, for example, Serfling, 1980). Thus, as discussed in Section 1.4, if the responses \\(y_i\\) are even approximately normally distributed, then it will be reasonable to use a normal approximation for the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\). Using \\(se(b_1)\\) as the estimated standard deviation of \\(b_1\\), for large values of \\(n\\) we have that \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) has an approximate standard normal distribution. Although we will not prove it here, under Assumption F5 \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) follows a $t $-distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df=n-2\\). 2.5 Statistical Inference Having fit a model with a data set, we can make a number of important statements. Generally, it is useful to think about these statements in three categories: (i) tests of hypothesized ideas, (ii) estimates of model parameters and (ii) predictions of new outcomes. 2.5.1 Is the Explanatory Variable Important?: The t-Test We respond to the question of whether the explanatory variable is important by investigating whether or not \\(\\beta_1=0\\). The logic is that if \\(\\beta_1=0\\), then the basic linear regression model no longer includes an explanatory variable \\(x\\). Thus, we translate our question of the importance of the explanatory variable into a narrower question that can be answered using the hypothesis testing framework. This narrower question is, is $ H_0:_1=0$ valid? We respond to this question by looking at the test statistic: \\[\\begin{equation*} t-\\mathrm{ratio}=\\frac{\\mathrm{estimator-hypothesized~value~of~parameter}} {\\mathrm{standard~error~of~the~estimator}}. \\end{equation*}\\] For the case of \\(H_0:\\beta_1=0\\) , we examine \\(t\\)-ratio \\(t(b_1)=b_1/se(b_1)\\) because the hypothesized value of \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0. This is the appropriate standardization because, under the null hypothesis and the model assumptions described in Section 2.4, the sampling distribution of \\(t(b_1)\\) can be shown to be the \\(t\\)-distribution with $ df=n-2$ degrees of freedom. Thus, to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) against the alternative \\(H_{a}:\\beta_1\\neq 0\\), we reject \\(H_0\\) if favor of \\(H_{a}\\) if \\(|t(b_1)|\\) exceeds a \\(t\\)-value. Here, this \\(t\\)-value is a percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution using \\(df=n-2\\) degrees of freedom.  We denote the significance level as $$  and this \\(t\\)-value as \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\). Example: Lottery Sales - Continued. For the lottery sales example, the residual standard deviation is \\(s=3,792\\). From Table 2.1, we have \\(s_x = 11,098\\). Thus, the standard error of the slope is \\(se(b_1) = 3792/(11098\\sqrt{50-1})=0.0488\\). From Section 2.1, the slope estimate is \\(b_1=0.647\\). Thus, the \\(t\\)-statistic is \\(t(b_1) = 0.647/0.0488 = 13.4\\). We interpret this by saying that the slope is 13.4 standard errors above zero. For the significance level, we use the customary value of \\(\\alpha\\) = 5%. The 97.5th percentile from a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=50-2=48\\) degrees of freedom is \\(t_{48,0.975}=2.011\\). Because \\(|13.4|&gt;2.011\\), we reject the null hypothesis that the slope \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) in favor of the alternative that \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). Making decisions by comparing a \\(t\\)-ratio to a \\(t\\)-value is called a \\(t\\)-test. Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1=0\\) versus \\(H_{a}:\\beta_1\\neq 0\\) is just one of many hypothesis tests that can be performed, although it is the most common. Table 2.3 outlines alternative decision-making procedures. These procedures are for testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) where \\(d\\) is a user-prescribed value that may be equal to zero or any other known value. For example, in our Section 2.7 example, we will use \\(d=1\\) to test financial theories about the stock market. Table 2.3 Decision-Making Procedures for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c} \\hline \\text{Alternative Hypothesis} (H_{a}) &amp; \\text{Procedure: Reject } H_0 \\text{ in favor of } H_{a} \\text{ if} \\\\ \\hline \\beta_1&gt;d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&gt;t_{n-2,1-\\alpha }. \\\\ \\beta_1&lt;d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&lt;-t_{n-2,1-\\alpha }. \\\\ \\beta_1\\neq d &amp; |t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}&gt;t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}. \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\text{Notes: The significance level is } \\alpha . \\text{Here, }t_{n-2,1-\\alpha} \\text{ the } (1-\\alpha )th \\text{ percentile}\\\\ ~~\\text{from the } t-\\text{distribution using } df=n-2 \\text{ degrees of freedom}.\\\\ ~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_1 -d)/se(b_1) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Alternatively, one can construct probability (\\(p\\)-) values and compare these to given significant levels. The \\(p\\)-value is a useful summary statistic for the data analyst to report since it allows the report reader to understand the strength of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Table 2.4 summarizes the procedure for calculating \\(p\\)-values. Table 2.4 Probability Values for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{c|ccc} \\hline \\text{Alternative} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Hypothesis} (H_a) &amp; \\beta_1&gt;d &amp; \\beta_1&lt;d &amp; \\beta_1\\neq d \\\\ \\hline p-value &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-2}&gt;t-\\mathrm{ratio}) &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-2}&lt;t-\\mathrm{ratio}) &amp; \\Pr (|t_{n-2}|&gt;|t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}) \\\\\\hline \\end{array} \\\\ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\text{Notes: Here, }t_{n-2} \\text{ is a } t-\\text{distributed random variable with } df=n-2 \\text{ degrees of freedom.}\\\\ ~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_1 -d)/se(b_1) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Another interesting way of addressing the question of the importance of an explanatory variable is through the correlation coefficient. Remember that the correlation coefficient is a measure of linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let’s denote this statistic by \\(r(y,x)\\). This quantity is unaffected by scale changes in either variable. For example, if we multiply the \\(x\\) variable by the number \\(b_1\\), then the correlation coefficient remains unchanged. Further, correlations are unchanged by additive shifts. Thus, if we add a number, say \\(b_0\\), to each \\(x\\) variable, then the correlation coefficient remains unchanged. Using a scale change and an additive shift on the \\(x\\) variable can be used to produce the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\). Thus, using notation, we have \\(r(y,x)=r(y,\\widehat{y}).\\) We may thus interpret the correlation between the responses and the explanatory variable to be equal to the correlation between the responses and the fitted values. This leads then to the following interesting algebraic fact, \\(R^2=r^2.\\) That is, the coefficient of determination equals the correlation coefficient squared. This is much easier to interpret if one thinks of \\(r\\) as the correlation between observed and fitted values. See Exercise 2.13 for steps useful in confirming this result. 2.5.2 Confidence Intervals Investigators often cite the formal hypothesis testing mechanism to respond to the question “Does the explanatory variable have a real influence on the response?” A natural follow-up question is “To what extent does \\(x\\) affect \\(y\\)?” To a certain degree, one could respond using the size of the \\(t\\)-ratio or the \\(p\\)-value. However, in many instances a confidence interval for the slope is more useful. To introduce confidence intervals for the slope, recall that \\(b_1\\) is our point estimator of the true, unknown slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Section 2.4 argued that this estimator has standard error \\(se(b_1)\\) and that \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. Probability statements can be inverted to yield confidence intervals. Using this logic, we have the following confidence interval for the slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Definition. A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% confidence interval for the slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{E2:ConfIntb1} b_1\\pm t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2} ~se(b_1). \\end{equation}\\] As with hypothesis testing, \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\) is the (1-$ $/2)th percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-2\\) degrees of freedom. Because of the two-sided nature of confidence intervals, the percentile is 1 - (1 - confidence level) / 2. In this text, for notational simplicity we generally use a 95% confidence interval, so the percentile is 1-(1-.0.95)/2 = 0.975. The confidence interval provides a range of reliability that measures the usefulness of the estimate. In Section 2.1, we established that the least squares slope estimate for the lottery sales example is \\(b_1=0.647\\). The interpretation is that if a zip code’s population differs by 1,000, then we expect mean lottery sales to differ by $647. How reliable is this estimate? It turns out that \\(se(b_1)=0.0488\\) and thus an approximate 95% confidence interval for the slope is \\[\\begin{equation*} 0.647\\pm (2.011)(.0488), \\end{equation*}\\] or (0.549, 0.745). Similarly, if population differs by 1,000, a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in sales is (549, 745). Here, we use the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{48,0.975}=2.011\\) because there are 48 (= $ n$-2) degrees of freedom and, for a 95% confidence interval, we need the 97.5th percentile. 2.5.3 Prediction Intervals In Section 2.1, we showed how to use least squares estimators to predict the lottery sales for a zip code, outside of our sample, having a population of 10,000. Because prediction is such an important task for actuaries, we formalize the procedure so that it can be used on a regular basis. To predict an additional observation, we assume that the level of explanatory variable is known and is denoted by \\(x_{\\ast}\\). For example, in our previous lottery sales example we used \\(x_{\\ast} = 10,000\\). We also assume that the additional observation follows the same linear regression model as the observations in the sample. Using our least square estimators, our point prediction is \\(\\widehat{y}_{\\ast} = b_0 + b_1 x_{\\ast}\\), the height of the fitted regression line at \\(x_{\\ast}\\) We may decompose the prediction error into two parts: It can be shown that the standard error of the prediction is \\[\\begin{equation*} se(pred) = s \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left( x_{\\ast}-\\overline{x}\\right) ^2}{(n-1)s_x^2}}. \\end{equation*}\\] As with \\(se(b_1)\\), the terms \\(n^{-1}\\) and $( x_{}- ) ^2/$ become close to zero as the sample size \\(n\\) becomes large. Thus, for large \\(n\\), we have that \\(se(pred)\\approx s\\), reflecting that the error in estimating the regression line at a point becomes negligible and deviation of the additional response from its mean becomes the entire source of uncertainty. Definition. A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% prediction interval at \\(x_{\\ast}\\) is \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{E2:predinteval} \\widehat{y}_{\\ast} \\pm t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2} ~se(pred) \\end{equation}\\] where the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\) is the same as used for hypothesis testing and the confidence interval. For example, the point prediction at \\(x_{\\ast} = 10,000\\) is \\(\\widehat{y}_{\\ast}\\)= 469.7 + 0.647 (10000) = 6,939.7. The standard error of this prediction is \\[\\begin{equation*} se(pred) = 3,792 \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{\\left( 10,000-9,311\\right)^2}{(50-1)(11,098)^2}} = 3,829.6. \\end{equation*}\\] With a \\(t\\)-value equal to 2.011, this yields an approximate 95% prediction interval \\[\\begin{equation*} 6,939.7 \\pm (2.011)(3,829.6) = 6,939.7 \\pm 7,701.3 = (-761.6, ~14,641.0). \\end{equation*}\\] We interpret these results by first pointing out that our best estimate of lottery sales for a zip code with a population of 10,000 is 6,939.70. Our 95% prediction interval represents a range of reliability for this prediction. If we could see many zip codes, each with a population of 10,000, on average we expect about 19 out of 20, or 95%, would have lottery sales between 0 and 14,641. It is customary to truncate the lower bound of the prediction interval to zero if negative values of the response are deemed to be inappropriate.

Statistics takes this one step further, using discrepancies between the assumptions and the data to improve model specification. We will examine the Section 2.2 modeling assumptions in light of the data and use any mismatch to specify a better model; this process is known as diagnostic checking (like when you go to a doctor and he or she performs diagnostic routines to check your health). We will begin with the Section 2.2 error representation. Under this set of assumptions, the deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are identically and independently distributed (i.i.d), and under assumption F5, normally distributed. To assess the validity of these assumptions, one uses (observed) residuals {\\(e_i\\)} as approximations for the (unobserved) deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)}. The basic theme is that if the residuals are related to a variable or display any other recognizable pattern, then we should be able to take advantage of this information and improve our model specification. The residuals should contain little or no information and represent only natural variation from the sampling that cannot be attributed to any specific source. Residual analysis is the exercise of checking the residuals for patterns. There are five types of model discrepancies that analysts commonly look for. If detected, the discrepancies can be corrected with the appropriate adjustments in the model specification. Model Misspecification Issues Lack of Independence. There may exist relationships among the deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} so that they are not independent. Heteroscedasticity. Assumption E3 that indicates that all observations have a common (although unknown) variability, known as homoscedasticity. Heteroscedascity is the term used when the variability varies by observation. Relationships between Model Deviations and Explanatory Variables. If an explanatory variable has the ability to help explain the deviation $$, then one should be able to use this information to better predict \\(y\\). Nonnormal Distributions. If the distribution of the deviation represents a serious departure from normality, then the usual inference procedures are no longer valid. Unusual Points. Individual observations may have a large effect on the regression model fit, meaning that the results may be sensitive to the impact of a single observation. \\end{enumerate} This list will serve the reader throughout your study of regression analysis. Of course, with only an introduction to basic models we have not yet seen alternative models that might be used when we encounter these model discrepancies. In this book’s Part II on time series models, we will study lack of independence among data ordered over time. Chapter 5 will consider heteroscedasticity in further detail. The introduction to multiple linear regression in Chapter 3 will be our first look at handling relationships between {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} and additional explanatory variables. We have, however, already had an introduction to the effect of normal distributions, seeing that \\(qq\\) plots can detect non-normality and that transformations can help induce approximate normality. In this section, we discuss the effects of unusual points. Much of residual analysis is done by examining a standardized residual, a residual divided by its standard error. An approximate standard error of the residual is \\(s\\); in Chapter 3 we will give a precise mathematical definition. There are two reasons why we often examine standardized residuals in lieu of basic residuals. First, if responses are normally distributed, then standardized residuals are approximately realizations from a standard normal distribution. This provides a reference distribution to compare values of standardized residuals. For example, if a standardized residual exceeds two in absolute value, this is considered unusually large and the observation is called an outlier. Second, because standardized residuals are dimensionless, we get carryover of experience from one data set to another. This is true regardless of whether or not the normal reference distribution is applicable. Outliers and High Leverage Points Another important part of residual analysis is the identification of unusual observations in a data set. Because regression estimates are weighted averages with weights that vary by observation, some observations are more important than others. This weighting is more important than many users of regression analysis realize. In fact, the example below demonstrates that a single observation can have a dramatic effect in a large data set. There are two directions in which a data point can be unusual, the horizontal and vertical directions. By “unusual,” we mean that an observation under consideration seems to be far from the majority of the data set. An observation that is unusual in the vertical direction is called an outlier. An observation that is unusual in the horizontal directional is called a high leverage point. An observation may be both an outlier and a high leverage point. Example: Outliers and High Leverage Points. Consider the fictitious data set of 19 points plus three points, labeled A, B, and C, given in Figure 2.7 and Table 2.5. Think of the first 19 points as “good” observations that represent some type of phenomena. We want to investigate the effect of adding a single aberrant point.

The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), indicates about 89% of the variability has been explained by the line. The size of the typical error, \\(s\\), is about 0.29, small compared to the scatter in the \\(y\\)-values. Further, the \\(t\\)-ratio for the slope coefficient is large. When the outlier point A is added to the nineteen base points, the situation deteriorates dramatically. The \\(R^2\\) drops from 89% to 53.7% and \\(s\\) increases from about 0.29 to about 0.85. The fitted regression line itself does not change that much even though our confidence in the estimates has decreased. An outlier is unusual in the \\(y\\)-value, but “unusual in the \\(y\\)-value” depends on the \\(x\\)-value. To see this, keep the \\(y\\)-value of Point A the same, but increase the \\(x\\)-value and call the point B. When the point B is added to the nineteen base points, the regression line provides a better fit. Point B is close to being on the line of the regression fit generated by the nineteen base points. Thus, the fitted regression line and the size of the typical error, \\(s\\), do not change much. However, \\(R^2\\) increases from 89% to nearly 95 percent. If we think of $ R^2$ as \\(1-(Error~SS)/(Total~SS)\\), by adding point B we have increased $ Total~SS$, the total squared deviations in the \\(y\\)’s, even though leaving $ Error~SS$ relatively unchanged. Point B is not an outlier, but it is a high leverage point. To show how influential this point is, drop the \\(y\\)-value considerably and call this the new point C. When this point is added to the nineteen base points, the situation deteriorates dramatically. The \\(R^2\\) coefficient drops from 89% to 10%, and the \\(s\\) more than triples, from 0.29 to 0.87. Further, the regression line coefficients change dramatically. Most users of regression at first do not believe that one point in twenty can have such a dramatic effect on the regression fit. The fit of a regression line can always be improved by removing an outlier. If the point is a high leverage point and not an outlier, it is not clear whether the fit will be improved when the point is removed. Simply because you can dramatically improve a regression fit by omitting an observation does not mean you should always do so! The goal of data analysis is to understand the information in the data. Throughout the text, we will encounter many data sets where the unusual points provide some of the most interesting information about the data. The goal of this subsection is to recognize the effects of unusual points; Chapter 5 will provide options for handling unusual points in your analysis. All quantitative disciplines, such as accounting, economics, linear programming, and so on, practice the art of sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a description of the global changes in a system due to a small local change in an element of the system. Examining the effects of individual observations on the regression fit is a type of sensitivity analysis. Example: Lottery Sales – Continued. Figure 2.8 exhibits an outlier; the point in the upper left-hand side of the plot represents a zip code that includes Kenosha, Wisconsin. Sales for this zip code are unusually high given its population. Kenosha is close to the Illinois border; residents from Illinois probably participate in the Wisconsin lottery thus effectively increasing the potential pool of sales in Kenosha. Table 2.7 summarizes the regression fit both with and without this zip code. Table 2.7. Regression Results with and without Kenosha \\[ \\begin{array}{l|rrrrr} \\hline \\text{Data} &amp; b_0 &amp; b_1 &amp; s &amp; R^2(\\%) &amp; t(b_1) \\\\ \\hline \\text{With Kenosha} &amp; 469.7 &amp; 0.647 &amp; 3,792 &amp; 78.5 &amp; 13.26 \\\\ \\text{Without Kenosha} &amp; -43.5 &amp; 0.662 &amp; 2,728 &amp; 88.3 &amp; 18.82 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Figure 2.8: Scatter plot of SALES versus POP, with the outlier corresponding to Kenosha marked.

Both slope estimates are qualitatively similar and the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistics are very high, well above cut-offs for statistical significance. However, there are dramatic differences when assessing the quality of the fit. The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), increased from 78.5% to 88.3% when deleting Kenosha. Moreover, our “typical deviation” \\(s\\) dropped by over $1,000. This is particularly important if we wish to tighten our prediction intervals. To check the accuracy of our assumptions, it is also customary to check the normality assumption. One way of doing this is the \\(qq\\) plot, introduced in Section 1.2. The two panels in Figures 2.9 are \\(qq\\) plots with and without the Kenosha zip code. Recall that points “close” to linear indicate approximate normality. In the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9, the sequence does appear to be linear so that residuals are approximately normally distributed. This is not the case in the left-hand panel, where the sequence of points appears to climb dramatically for large quantiles. The interesting thing is that the non-normality of the distribution is due to a single outlier, not a pattern of skewness that is common to all the observations.

The name is something of a misnomer in that the model is really about returns based on capital assets, not the prices themselves. The types of assets that we examine are equity securities that are traded on an active market, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). For a stock on the exchange, we can relate returns to prices through the following expression: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{return=}\\frac{\\mathrm{ price~at~the~end~of~a~period+dividends-price~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}}{ \\mathrm{price~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}}. \\end{equation*}\\] If we can estimate the returns that a stock generates, then knowledge of the price at the beginning of a generic financial period allows us to estimate the value at the end of the period (ending price plus dividends). Thus, we follow standard practice and model returns of a security. An intuitively appealing idea, and one of the basic characteristics of the CAPM, is that there should be a relationship between the performance of a security and the market. One rationale is simply that if economic forces are such that the market improves, then those same forces should act upon an individual stock, suggesting that it also improve. As noted above, we measure performance of a security through the return. To measure performance of the market, several market indices exist that summarize the performance of each exchange. We will use the “equally-weighted” index of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 is the collection of the 500 largest companies traded on the NYSE, where “large” is identified by Standard &amp; Poor’s, a financial services rating organization. The equally-weighted index is defined by assuming a portfolio is created by investing one dollar in each of the 500 companies. Another rationale for a relationship between security and market returns comes from financial economics theory. This is the CAPM theory, attributed to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) and based on the portfolio diversification ideas of Harry Markowitz (1959). Other things equal, investors would like to select a return with a high expected value and low standard deviation, the latter being a measure of risk. One of the desirable properties about using standard deviations as a measure of riskiness is that it is straight-forward to calculate the standard deviation of a portfolio. One only needs to know the standard deviation of each security and the correlations among securities. A notable security is a risk-free one, that is, a security that theoretically has a zero standard deviation. Investors often use a 30-day U.S. Treasury bill as an approximation of a risk-free security, arguing that the probability of default of the U.S. government within 30 days is negligible. Positing the existence of a risk-free asset and some other mild conditions, under the CAPM theory there exists an efficient frontier called the securities market line. This frontier specifies the minimum expected return that investors should demand for a specified level of risk. To estimate this line, we can use the equation \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E}~r = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 r_m \\end{equation*}\\] where \\(r\\) is the security return and \\(r_m\\) is the market return. We interpret \\(\\beta_1 r_m\\) as a measure of the amount of security return that is attributed to the behavior of the market. Testing economic theory, or models arising from any discipline, involves collecting data. The CAPM theory is about ex-ante (before the fact) returns even though we can only test with ex-post (after the fact) returns. Before the fact, the returns are unknown and there is an entire distribution of returns. After the fact, there is only a single realization of the security and market return. Because at least two observations are required to determine a line, CAPM models are estimated using security and market data gathered over time. In this way, several observations can be made. For the purposes of our discussions, we follow standard practice in the securities industry and examine monthly prices. Data To illustrate, consider monthly returns over the five year period from January, 1986 to December, 1990, inclusive. Specifically, we use the security returns from the Lincoln National Insurance Corporation as the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) and the market returns from the index of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index as the explanatory variable (\\(x\\)). At the time, the Lincoln was a large, multi-line, insurance company, headquartered in the midwest of the U.S., specifically in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Because it was well known for its’ prudent management and stability, it is a good company to begin our analysis of the relationship between the market and an individual stock. We begin by interpreting some of basic summary statistics, in Table 2.8, in terms of financial theory. First, an investor in the Lincoln will be concerned that the five year average return, \\(\\overline{y}=0.00510\\), is below the return of the market, \\(\\overline{x}=0.00741\\). Students of interest theory recognize that monthly returns can be converted to an annual basis using geometric compounding. For example, the annual return of the Lincoln is \\((1.0051)^{12}-1=0.062946\\), or roughly 6.29 percent. This is compared to an annual return of 9.26% (= (1\\(00((1.00741)^{12}-1\\))) for the market. A measure of risk, or volatility, that is used in finance is the standard deviation. Thus, interpret \\(s_y\\) = 0.0859 \\(&gt;\\) 0.05254 = \\(s_x\\) to mean that an investment in the Lincoln is riskier than that of the market. Another interesting aspect of Table 2.8 is that the smallest market return, -0.22052, is 4.338 standard deviations below its average ((-0.22052-0.00741)/0.05254 = -4.338). This is highly unusual with respect to a normal distribution. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly. Create a table just to update the counter...&quot;) Table 2.2: Silly.

These are scatter plots of the returns versus time, called time series plots. In Figure 2.10, one can clearly see the smallest market return and a quick glance at the horizontal axis reveals that this unusual point is in October, 1987, the time of the well-known market crash. Figure 2.10: Time series plot of returns from the Lincoln National Corporation and the market. There are 60 monthly returns over the period January, 1986 through December, 1990. The scatter plot in Figure 2.11 graphically summarizes the relationship between Lincoln’s return and the return of the market. The market crash is clearly evident in Figure 2.11 and represents a high leverage point. With the regression line (described below) superimposed, the two outlying points that can be seen in Figure 2.10 are also evident. Despite these anomalies, the plot in Figure 2.11 does suggest that there is a linear relationship between Lincoln and market returns. Figure 2.11: Scatterplot of Lincoln’s return versus the S&amp;P 500 Index return. The regression line is superimposed, enabling us to identify the market crash and two outliers.

The fitted regression is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{LINCOLN}=-0.00214+0.973 MARKET. \\end{equation*}\\] The resulting estimated standard error, \\(s\\) = 0.0696 is lower than the standard deviation of Lincoln’s returns, \\(s_y=0.0859\\). Thus, the regression model explains some of the variability of Lincoln’s returns. Further, the \\(t\\)-statistic associated with the slope \\(b_1\\) turns out to be \\(t(b_1)=5.64\\), which is significantly large. One disappointing aspect is that the statistic \\(R^2=35.4\\%\\) can be interpreted as saying that the market explains only a little over a third of the variability. Thus, even though the market is clearly an important determinant, as evidenced by the high \\(t\\)-statistic, it provides only a partial explanation of the performance of the Lincoln’s returns. In the context of the market model, we may interpret the standard deviation of the market, \\(s_x\\), as non-diversifiable risk. Thus, the risk of a security can be decomposed into two components, the diversifiable component and the market component, which is non-diversifiable. The idea here is that by combining several securities we can create a portfolio of securities that, in most instances, will reduce the riskiness of our holdings when compared with a single security. Again, the rationale for holding a security is that we are compensated through higher expected returns by holding a security with higher riskiness. To quantify the relative riskiness, it is not hard to show that \\[\\begin{equation} s_y^2 = b_1^2 s_x^2 + s^2 \\frac{n-2}{n-1}. \\end{equation}\\] The riskiness of a security is due to the riskiness due to the market plus the riskiness due to a diversifiable component. Note that the riskiness due to the market component, \\(s_x^2\\), is larger for securities with larger slopes. For this reason, investors think of securities with slopes \\(b_1\\) greater than one as “aggressive” and slopes less than one as “defensive.” Sensitivity Analysis The above summary immediately raises two additional issues. First, what is the effect of the October, 1987 crash on the fitted regression equation? We know that unusual observations, such as the crash, may potentially influence the fit a great deal. To this end, the regression was re-run without the observation corresponding to the crash. The motivation for this is that the October 1987 crash represents a combination of highly unusual events (the interaction of several automated trading programs operated by the large stock brokerage houses) that we do not wish to represent using the same model as our other observations. Deleting this observation, the fitted regression is \\[\\begin{equation*} \\widehat{LINCOLN} = -0.00181 + 0.956 MARKET, \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(R^2=26.4\\%\\), \\(t(b_1)=4.52\\), \\(s=0.0702\\) and \\(s_y=0.0811\\). We interpret these statistics in the same fashion as the fitted model including the October 1987 crash. It is interesting to note, however, that the proportion of variability explained has actually decreased when excluding the influential point. This serves to illustrate an important point. High leverage points are often looked upon with dread by data analysts because they are, by definition, unlike other observations in the data set and require special attention. However, when fitting relationships among variables, they also represent an opportunity because they allow the data analyst to observe the relationship between variables over broader ranges than otherwise possible. The downside is that these relationships may be nonlinear or follow an entirely different pattern when compared to the relationships observed in the main portion of the data. The second question raised by the regression analysis is what can be said about the unusual circumstances that gave rise to the unusual behavior of Lincoln’s returns in October and November of 1990. A useful feature of regression analysis is to identify and raise the question; it does not resolve it. Because the analysis clearly pinpoints two highly unusual points, it suggests to the data analyst to go back and ask some specific questions about the sources of the data. In this case, the answer is straightforward. In October of 1990, the Travelers’ Insurance Company, a competitor, announced that it would take a large write-off in their real estate portfolio. due to an unprecedented number of mortgage defaults. The market reacted quickly to this news, and investors assumed that other large stock life insurers would also soon announce large write-offs. Anticipating this news, investors tried to sell their portfolios of, for example, Lincoln’s stock, thus causing the price to plummet. However, it turned out that investors overreacted to this news and that Lincoln’s portfolio of real estate was indeed sound. Thus, prices quickly returned to their historical levels. 2.8 Illustrative Regression Computer Output Computers and statistical software packages that perform specialized calculations play a vital role in modern-day statistical analyses. Inexpensive computing capabilities have allowed data analysts to focus on relationships of interest. Specifying models that are attractive merely for their computational simplicity is much less important now compared to times before the widespread availability of inexpensive computing. An important theme of this text is to focus on relationships of interest and to rely on widely available statistical software to estimate the models that we specify. With any computer package, generally the most difficult parts of operating the package are the (i) input, (ii) using the commands and (iii) interpreting the output. You will find that most modern statistical software packages accept spreadsheet or text-based files, making input of data relatively easy. Personal computer statistical software packages have menu-driven command languages with easily accessible on-line help facilities. Once you decide what to do, finding the right commands is relatively easy. This section provides guidance in interpreting the output of statistical packages. Most statistical packages generate similar output. Below, three examples of standard statistical software packages, EXCEL, SAS and R are given. The annotation symbol “[.]” marks a statistical quantity that is described in the legend. Thus, this section provides a link between the notation used in the text and output from some of the standard statistical software packages.

Show that the intercept term, \\(b_0\\), can be expressed as a weighted sum of the dependent variables. That is, show that \\(b_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i,0}y_i.\\) Further, express the weights in terms of the slope weights, \\(w_i\\). 2.5 Another expression for the slope as a weighted sum Using algebra, establish an alternative expression \\[\\begin{equation*} b_1=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}weight_i~slope_i}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}weight_i}. \\end{equation*}\\] Here, \\(slope_i\\) is the slope between \\((x_i,y_i)\\) and \\((\\bar{x},\\bar{y})\\). Give a precise form for the weight \\(weight_i\\) as a function of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). Suppose that \\(\\bar{x} = 4,\\bar{y} = 3, x_1 = 2 \\mathrm{~and~} y_1= 6\\).

Consider the model \\(y_i=\\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon _i\\), that is, regression with one explanatory variable without the intercept term. This model is called regression through the origin because the true regression line \\(\\mathrm{E}y = \\beta_1 x\\) passes through the origin (the point (0, 0)). For this model, the least squares estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) is that number \\(b_1\\) that minimizes the sum of squares \\(\\mathrm{SS}(b_1^{\\ast} )=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) ^2.\\) Verify that \\[\\begin{equation*} b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2}. \\end{equation*}\\] Consider the model \\(y_i=\\beta_1 z_i^2 + \\varepsilon _i\\), a quadratic model passing through the origin.

Suppose that \\(x_i\\) only takes on the values 0 and 1. Out of the \\(n\\) observations, \\(n_1\\) take on the value \\(x=0\\). These $n_1 $ observations have an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_1\\). the remaining \\(n-n_1\\) observations have value \\(x=1\\) and an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_2\\). Use Exercise 2.8 to show that \\(b_1 = \\overline{y}_2 - \\overline{y}_1.\\) 2.10 Nursing Home Utilization.

Determine \\(s\\). 2.13 The correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. Use the following steps to establish a relationship between the coefficient of determination and the correlation coefficient. Show that \\(\\widehat{y}_i-\\overline{y}=b_1(x_i-\\overline{x}).\\) Use part (a) to show that \\(Regress~SS=\\) \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2\\) \\(= b_1^2s_x^2(n-1).\\) Use part (b) to establish \\(R^2=r^2.\\) 2.14 Show that the average residual is zero, that is, show that \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i=0.\\) 2.15 Correlation between residuals and explanatory variables. Consider a generic sequence of pairs of numbers (\\(x_1,y_1\\)), …, (\\(x_n,y_n\\)) with the correlation coefficient computed as \\(r(y,x)=\\left[ (n-1)s_ys_x\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) \\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) .\\) Suppose that either \\(\\overline{y}=0,\\overline{x}=0\\) or both \\(\\overline{x}\\)  and \\(\\overline{y}=0.\\) Then, check that \\(r(y,x)=0\\) implies \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i x_i=0\\) and vice-versa. Show that the correlation between the residuals and the explanatory variables is zero. Do this by using part (a) of Exercise 2.13 to show that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i e_i = 0\\) and then apply part (a). Show that the correlation between the residuals and fitted values is zero. Do this by showing that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{y}_i e_i = 0\\)  and then apply part (a). 2.16 Correlation and \\(t\\)-statistics. Use the following steps to establish a relationship between the correlation coefficient and the \\(t\\)-statistic for the slope. a Use algebra to check that \\[\\begin{equation*} R^2=1-\\frac{n-2}{n-1}\\frac{s^2}{s_y^2}. \\end{equation*}\\] Use part (a) to establish the following quick computational formula for \\(s,\\) \\[\\begin{equation*}s = s_y \\sqrt{(1-r^2)\\frac{n-1}{n-2}}.\\end{equation*}\\] Use part (b) to show that \\[\\begin{equation*} t(b_1) = \\sqrt{n-2}\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}. \\end{equation*}\\] Sections 2.6-2.7 2.17 Effects of an unusual point. You are analyzing a data set of size \\(n=100\\). You have just performed a regression analysis using one predictor variable and notice that the residual for the 10th observation is unusually large. Suppose that, in fact, it turns out that \\(e_{10}=8s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? Suppose that \\(e_{10}=4s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? Suppose that you reduce the data set to size \\(n=20\\). After running the regression, it turns out that we still have \\(10=4s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? 2.18 Consider a data set consisting of 20 observations with the following summary statistics: \\(\\overline{x}=0\\), \\(\\overline{y}=9\\), \\(s_x=1\\) and \\(s_y=10\\). You run a regression using using one variable and determine that \\(s=7\\). Determine the standard error of a prediction at \\(x_{\\ast}=1.\\) 2.19 Summary statistics can hide important relationships. The data in Table 2.9 is due to Anscombe (1973). The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how plotting data can reveal important information that is not evident in numerical summary statistics. Table 2.9.

Check that the averages and standard deviations of each of the \\(x\\) columns are the same, within two decimal places, and similarly for each of the \\(y\\) columns. Run four regressions, (1) \\(y_{1}\\) on \\(x_{1}\\), (2) \\(y_2\\) on \\(x_{1}\\), (3) \\(y_{3}\\) on \\(x_{1}\\) and (4) \\(y_{4}\\) on \\(x_2\\).

Produce scatter plots for each of the four regression models that you fit in part (b). Discuss the fact that the fitted regression models produced in part (b) imply that the four data sets are similar although the four scatter plots produced in part (c) yield a dramatically different story. 2.20 Nursing Home Utilization. This exercise considers nursing home data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) and described in Exercise 1.2 and 2.10. You decide to examine the relationship between total patient years (LOGTPY) and the number of beds (LOGNUMBED), both in logarithmic units, using cost report year 2001 data. Summary statistics. Create basic summary statistics for each variable. Summarize the relationship through a correlation statistic and a scatter plot. Fit the basic linear model. Cite the basic summary statistics, include the coefficient of determination, the regression coefficient for LOGNUMBED and the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistic. Hypothesis testing. Test the following hypotheses at the 5 level of significance using a \\(t\\)-statistic. Also compute the corresponding \\(p\\)-value. c(i). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). c(ii). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 1\\). c(iii). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 &gt; 1\\). c(iv). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 &lt; 1\\). You are interested in the effect that a marginal change in LOGNUMBED has on the expected value of LOGTPY. d(i). Suppose that there is a marginal change in LOGNUMBED of 2. Provide a point estimate of the expected change in LOGTPY. d(ii). Provide a 95% confidence interval corresponding to the point estimate in part d(i). d(iii). Provide a 99% confidence interval corresponding to the point estimate in part d(i). At a specified number of beds estimate \\(x_{*} = 100\\), do these things: e(i). Find the predicted value of LOGTPY. e(ii). Obtain the standard error of the prediction. e(iii). Obtain a 95% prediction interval for your prediction. e(iv). Convert the point prediction in part e(i) and the prediction interval obtained in part e(iii) into total person years (through exponentiation). e(v). Obtain a prediction interval as in part e(iv), corresponding to a 90% level (in lieu of 95%). 2.21 Initial Public Offerings. As a financial analyst, you wish to convince a client of the merits of investing in firms that have just entered a stock exchange, as an IPO (initial public offering). Thus, you gather data on 116 firms that priced during the six-month time frame of January 1, 1998 through June 1, 1998. By looking at this recent historical data, you are able to compute RETURN, the firm’s one-year return (in percent). You are also interested in looking at financial characteristics of the firm that may help you understand (and predict) the return. You initially examine REVENUE, the firm’s 1997 revenues in millions of dollars. Unfortunately, this variable was not available for six firms. Thus, the statistics below are for the 110 firms that have both REVENUES and RETURNS. In addition, Table 2.9 provides information on the (natural) logarithmic revenues, denoted as LnREV, and the initial price of the stock, denoted as PRICEIPO. Table 2.9: Summary Statistics of Each Variable Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum RETURN 0.106 -0.130 0.824 -0.938 4.333 REV 134.487 39.971 261.881 0.099 1455.761 LnREV 3.686 3.688 1.698 -2.316 7.283 PRICEIPO 13.195 13.000 4.694 4.000 29.000 You hypothesize that larger firms, as measured by revenues, are more stable and thus should enjoy greater returns. You have determined that the correlation between RETURN and REVENUE is -0.0175. a(i). Calculate the least squares fit using REVENUE to predict RETURN. Determine \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). a(ii). For Hyperion Telecommunications, REVENUEs are 95.55 (millions of dollars). Calculate the fitted RETURN using the regression fit in part a(i). Table 2.11. Regression Results from a Model Fit with Logarithmic Revenues \\[ \\begin{array}{l|rrr} \\hline &amp; &amp; \\text{Standard} &amp; \\\\ \\text{Variable} &amp; \\text{Coefficient} &amp; \\text{Error} &amp; t-\\text{statistic} \\\\ \\hline \\text{INTERCEPT} &amp; 0.438 &amp; 0.186 &amp; 2.35\\\\ \\text{LnREV} &amp; -0.090 &amp; 0.046 &amp; -1.97 \\\\ \\hline s = 0.8136, &amp; R^2 = 0.03452 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] b. Logarithmic revenues and returns. b(i). Suppose instead that you use LnREVs to predict RETURN. Calculate the fitted RETURN under this regression model. Is this equal your answer in part a(ii)? b(ii) Do logarithmic revenues significantly affect returns? To this end, provide a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Use a 10% level of significance. b(iii). You conjecture that, other things equal, that firms with larger revenues will be more stable and thus enjoy a larger initial return. Thus, you wish to consider the null hypothesis of no relation between LnREV and RETURN versus the alternative hypothesis that there is a positive relation between LnREV and RETURN. To this end, provide a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Use a 10% level of significance. Determine the correlation between LnREV and RETURN. Be sure to state whether this correlation is positive, negative or zero. You are considering investing in a firm that has LnREV = 2 (so revenues are \\(e^2\\) = 7.389 millions of dollars). d(i). Using the fitted regression model, determine the least squares point prediction. d(ii). Determine the 95% prediction interval corresponding to your prediction in part d(i). The \\(R^2\\) from the fitted regression model is a disappointing 3.5%. Part of the difficulty is due to observation number 59, the Inktomi Corporation. Inktomi sales are 12th smallest of the data set, with LnREV = 1.76 (so revenues are \\(e^{1.76} = 5.79\\) millions of dollars), yet it has the highest first year return, with RETURN = 433.33. e(i). Calculate the residual for this observation. e(ii). What proportion of the unexplained variability (error sum of squares) does this observation account for? e(iii). Define the idea of a high leverage observation. e(iv). Would this observation be considered a high leverage observation? Justify your answer. 2.22 National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercise 1.7 by examining the relation between \\(y= LIFEEXP\\) and \\(x=FERTILITY\\), shown in Figure 2.12. Fit a linear regression model of \\(LIFEEXP\\) using the explanatory variable \\(x=FERTILITY\\). Figure 2.12: Plot of FERTILITY versus LIFEEXP. The US has a FERTILITY rate of 2.0. Determine the fitted life expectancy. The island nation Dominica did not report a FERTILITY rate and thus was not included in the regression. Suppose that its FERTILITY rate is 2.0. Provide a 95% prediction interval for the life expectancy in Dominica. China has a FERTILITY rate of 1.7 and a life expectancy of 72.5. Determine the residual under the model. How many multiples of \\(s\\) is this residual from zero? Suppose that your prior hypothesis is that the FERTILITY slope is -6.0 and you wish to test the null hypothesis that the slope has increased (that is, the slope is greater than -6.0). Test this hypothesis at the 5% level of significance. Also compute an approximate \\(p\\)-value. 2.11 Technical Supplement - Elements of Matrix Algebra Examples are an excellent tool for introducing technical topics such as regression. However, this chapter has also used algebra as well as basic probability and statistics to give you further insights into regression analysis. Going forward, we will be studying multivariate relationships. With many things happening concurrently in several dimensions, algebra is no longer useful for providing insights. Instead, we will need matrix algebra. This supplement provides a brief introduction to matrix algebra to allow you to study the linear regression chapters of this text. It re-introduces basic linear regression to give you a feel for things that will be coming up in subsequent chapters when we extend basic linear regression to the multivariate case. Appendix A3 defines additional matrix concepts. 2.11.1 Basic Definitions A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns (the plural of matrix is matrices). For example, consider the income and age of 3 people. \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}= \\begin{array}{c} Row~1 \\\\ Row~2 \\\\ Row~3 \\end{array} \\overset{ \\begin{array}{cc} ~~~Col~1~ &amp; Col~2 \\end{array} }{\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6,000 &amp; 23 \\\\ 13,000 &amp; 47 \\\\ 11,000 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) } \\end{equation*}\\] Here, column 1 represents income and column 2 represents age. Each row corresponds to an individual. For example, the first individual is 23 years old with an income of $6,000. The number of rows and columns is called the dimension of the matrix. For example, the dimension of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) above is \\(3\\times 2\\) (read 3 “by” 2). This stands for 3 rows and 2 columns. If we were to represent the income and age of 100 people, then the dimension of the matrix would be \\(100\\times 2\\). It is convenient to represent a matrix using the notation \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{31} \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Here, \\(a_{ij}\\) is the symbol for the number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In general, we work with matrices of the form \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] In this case, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(n\\times k\\). A vector is a special matrix. A row vector is a matrix containing only 1 row (\\(k=1\\)). A column vector is a matrix containing only 1 column (\\(n=1\\)). For example, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\text{column vector}\\rightarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~~\\text{row vector}\\rightarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Notice above that the row vector takes much less room on a printed page than the corresponding column vector. A basic operation that relates these two quantities is the transpose. The transpose of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is defined by interchanging the rows and columns and is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{A }^{\\prime }\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\)). For example, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6,000 &amp; 23 \\\\ 13,000 &amp; 47 \\\\ 11,000 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime }=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 6,000 &amp; 13,000 &amp; 11,000 \\\\ 23 &amp; 47 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Thus, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(n\\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime }\\) has dimensions \\(k\\times n\\). 2.11.2 Some Special Matrices 2.11.3 Basic Operations Scalar Multiplication Let \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by a \\(n\\times k\\) matrix and let \\(c\\) be a real number. That is, a real number is a \\(1\\times 1\\) matrix and is also called a scalar. Multiplying a scalar \\(c\\) by a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is denoted by \\(c\\mathbf{A}\\) and defined by \\[\\begin{equation*} c\\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} ca_{11} &amp; ca_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ ca_{n1} &amp; ca_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] For example, suppose that \\(c=10\\) and \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 6 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{~~~~ then ~~~~ }\\mathbf{B}=c\\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 10 &amp; 20 \\\\ 60 &amp; 80 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Note that \\(c\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}c\\). Addition and Subtraction of Matrices Let \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) be matrices with dimensions \\(n\\times k\\). Use \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(b_{ij}\\) to denote the numbers in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. Then, the matrix $ =+$ is defined to be the matrix with $ (a_{ij}+b_{ij})$ in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Similarly, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\) is defined to be the matrix with \\((a_{ij}-b_{ij})\\) in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Symbolically, we write this as the following. \\[\\begin{equation*} \\text{If }\\mathbf{A=}\\left( a_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{ and } \\mathbf{B=}\\left( b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{, then} \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B=}\\left( a_{ij}+b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{ and }\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B=}\\left( a_{ij}-b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}. \\end{equation*}\\] For example, consider \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] Then \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6 &amp; 11 \\\\ 12 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -4 &amp; 0 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Basic Linear Regression Example of Addition and Subtraction. Now, recall that the basic linear regression model can be written as \\(n\\) equations: \\[\\begin{equation*} \\begin{array}{c} y_1=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\varepsilon _1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_n+\\varepsilon _n. \\end{array} \\end{equation*}\\] We can define \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{y}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\text{and}~~~ \\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y} =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_n \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] With this notation, we can express the \\(n\\) equations more compactly as \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y}+\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\\). Matrix Multiplication In general, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(n\\times c\\) and $ $ is a matrix of dimension \\(c\\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{AB }\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(n\\times k\\) and is defined by \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{AB=}\\left( \\sum_{s=1}^{c}a_{is}b_{sj}\\right) _{ij}. \\end{equation*}\\] For example consider the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] The matrix \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 2\\). To illustrate the calculation, consider the number in the first row and second column of $ $. By the rule presented above, with \\(i=1\\) and \\(j=2\\), the corresponding element of \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) is \\(\\sum_{s=1}^2a_{1s}b_{s2}=\\) \\(a_{11}b_{12}+a_{12}b_{22}=2(6)+5(1)=17\\). The other calculations are summarized as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{AB}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2(4)+5(8) &amp; 2(6)+5(1) \\\\ 4(4)+1(8) &amp; 4(6)+1(1) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 48 &amp; 17 \\\\ 24 &amp; 25 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] As another example, suppose \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Because \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 3\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) has dimension \\(3\\times 1\\), this means that the product \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 1\\).. The calculations are summarized as \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{AB}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 1(3)+2(5)+4(2) \\\\ 0(3)+5(5)+(2) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 21 \\\\ 41 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] For some additional examples, we have \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 2 \\\\ 5 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 4a_1+2a_2 \\\\ 5a_1+8a_2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{array} \\right) =2^2+3^2+5^2=38~~~\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 6 &amp; 10 \\\\ 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 15 \\\\ 10 &amp; 15 &amp; 25 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] In general, you see that \\(\\mathbf{AB\\neq BA}\\) in matrix multiplication, unlike multiplication of scalars (real numbers). Further, we remark that the identity matrix serves the role of “one” in matrix multiplication, in that \\(\\mathbf{AI=A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IA=A}\\) for any matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), providing that the dimensions are compatible to allow matrix multiplication.

Define \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{X}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; x_1 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\text{ and }\\boldsymbol \\beta =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{, to get } \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta =\\left( \\text{\\ } \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{\\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y.}} \\end{equation*}\\] Thus, this yields the familiar matrix expression of the regression model, $ + .$ Other useful quantities include \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} y_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) =y_1^2+\\cdots +y_n^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i^2, \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ x_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i \\end{array} \\right) \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ x_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; x_1 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation*}\\] Note that \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\) is a symmetric matrix. Matrix Inverses In matrix algebra, there is no concept of “division.” Instead, we extend the concept of “reciprocals” of real numbers. To begin, suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a square matrix of dimension \\(k \\times k\\) and let \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) be the \\(k\\times k\\) identity matrix. If there exists a \\(k \\times k\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{AB}=\\mathbf{I=BA}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is called the inverseof \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and is written \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{A}^{-1}. \\end{equation*}\\] Now, not all square matrices have inverses. Further, even when an inverse exists, it may not be easy to compute by hand. One exception to this rule are diagonal matrices. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is diagonal matrix of the form \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{kk} \\end{array} \\right). \\text{ Then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\frac{1}{a_{11}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{1}{a_{kk}} \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] For example, \\[\\begin{equation*} \\begin{array}{cccc} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -19 \\end{array} \\right) &amp; \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{1}{2} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\frac{1}{19} \\end{array} \\right) &amp; = &amp; \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ \\mathbf{A} &amp; \\mathbf{A}^{-1} &amp; = &amp; \\mathbf{I} \\end{array} . \\end{equation*}\\] In the case of a matrix of dimension \\(2\\times 2\\), the inversion procedure can be accomplished by hand easily even when the matrix is not diagonal. In the \\(2\\times 2\\) case, we suppose that if \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{array} \\right), \\text{ then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{array} \\right) \\text{.} \\end{equation*}\\] Thus, for example, if \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{ then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{2(4)-2(3)} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -2 \\\\ -3 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -3/2 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{.} \\end{equation*}\\] As a check, we have \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{A\\mathbf{A}^{-1}=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -3/2 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2(2)-2(3/2) &amp; 2(-1)+2(1) \\\\ 3(2)-4(3/2) &amp; 3(-1)+4(1) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{I}\\text{.} \\end{equation*}\\] Basic Linear Regression Example of Matrix Inverses. With \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n &amp; \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i &amp; \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 \\end{array} \\right), \\end{equation*}\\] we have \\[\\begin{equation*} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\right) ^2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 &amp; -\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\\\ -\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i &amp; n \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] To simplify this expression, recall that \\(\\overline{x}=n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\). Thus, \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{E2:XPXInv} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 &amp; -\\overline{x} \\\\ -\\overline{x} &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{equation}\\] Section 3.1 will discuss the relation \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\). To illustrate the calculation, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathbf{b} &amp;=&amp;\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{X} ^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 &amp; -\\overline{x} \\\\ -\\overline{x} &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\overline{y}x_i^2-\\overline{x} x_iy_i\\right) \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i-n\\overline{x}\\overline{y} \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] From this expression, we may see \\[\\begin{equation*} b_1=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i-n\\overline{x}\\overline{y}}{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2} \\end{equation*}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation*} b_0=\\frac{\\overline{y}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\\overline{x} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x} ^2}=\\frac{\\overline{y}\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x} ^2\\right) -\\overline{x}\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i - n\\overline{x} \\overline{y}\\right) }{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}= \\overline{y}-b_1\\overline{x}. \\end{equation*}\\] These are the usual expressions for the slope \\(b_1\\) (Exercise 2A.8) and intercept \\(b_0\\). 2.11.4 Random Matrices Expectations. Consider a matrix of random variables \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathbf{U=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} u_{11} &amp; u_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{1c} \\\\ u_{21} &amp; u_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{2c} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{n1} &amp; u_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{nc} \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] When we write the expectation of a matrix, this is short-hand for the matrix of expectations. Specifically, suppose that the joint probability function of \\({u_{11}, u_{12}, ..., u_{1c}, ..., u_{n1}, ..., u_{nc}}\\) is available to define the expectation operator. Then we define \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E} ~ \\mathbf{U} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{E }u_{11} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{1c} \\\\ \\mathrm{E }u_{21} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{2c} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E }u_{n1} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{nc} \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] As an important special case, consider the joint probability function for the random variables \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) and the corresponding expectations operator. Then \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{E}~ \\mathbf{y=} \\mathrm{E } \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{E }y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E }y_n \\end{array} \\right). \\end{equation*}\\] By the linearity of expectations, for a non-random matrix A and vector , we have E ( + ) = E . Variances. We can also work with second moments of random vectors. The variance of a vector of random variables is called the variance-covariance matrix. It is defined by \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var} ~ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{E} ( (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathrm{E} \\mathbf{y})(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathrm{E} \\mathbf{y})^{\\prime} ). \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] That is, we can express \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y=} \\mathrm{E } \\left( \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 -\\mathrm{E } y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n -\\mathrm{E } y_n \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} y_1 - \\mathrm{E } y_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_n - \\mathrm{E } y_n \\end{array}\\right) \\right) \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var}~y_1 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1, y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp;\\mathrm{Cov}(y_1, y_n) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2, y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2, y_n) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n, y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n, y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_n \\\\ \\end{array}\\right), \\end{equation*}\\] because \\(\\mathrm{E} ( (y_i - \\mathrm{E} y_i)(y_j - \\mathrm{E} y_j) ) = \\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j)\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_i) = \\mathrm{Var}~y_i\\). In the case that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are mutually uncorrelated, we have that \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j)=0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) and thus \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y=} \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var}~y_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_n \\\\ \\end{array}\\right). \\end{equation*}\\] Further, if the variances are identical so that \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma ^2\\), then we can write \\(\\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} = \\sigma ^2 \\mathbf{I}\\), where I is the \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix. For example, if \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are i.i.d., then \\(\\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} = \\sigma ^2 \\mathbf{I}\\). From equation (2.5), it can be shown that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{Ay +B} \\right) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{Ay} \\right) = \\mathbf{A} \\left( \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}. \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] For example, if \\(\\mathbf{A} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n)= \\mathbf{a}^{\\prime}\\) and B = 0, then equation (2.6) reduces to \\[\\begin{equation*} \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i \\right) = \\mathrm{Var} \\left( \\mathbf{a^{\\prime} y} \\right) = \\mathbf{a^{\\prime}} \\left( \\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n) \\left( \\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{array}\\right) \\end{equation*}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\mathrm{Var} ~y_i ~+~2 \\sum_{i=2}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_i a_j \\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j). \\end{equation*}\\] Definition - Multivariate Normal Distribution. A vector of random variables \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\right)^{\\prime}\\) is said to be multivariate normal if all linear combinations of the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i\\) are normally distributed. In this case, we write \\(\\mathbf{y} \\sim N (\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma} )\\), where \\(\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu} = \\mathrm{E}~ \\mathbf{y}\\) is the expected value of y and \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}= \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y}\\) is the variance-covariance matrix of y. From the definition, we have that \\(\\mathbf{y}\\sim N (\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma} )\\) implies that \\(\\mathbf{a^{\\prime}y}\\sim N (\\mathbf{a^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{a^{\\prime}\\Sigma a})\\). Thus, if \\(y_i\\) are i.i.d., then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i\\) is distributed normally with mean \\(\\mu \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) and variance \\(\\sigma ^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i ^2\\).

This chapter introduces linear regression in the case of several explanatory variables, known as multiple linear regression. Many basic linear regression concepts extend directly, including goodness of fit measures such as \\(R^2\\) and inference using \\(t\\)-statistics. Multiple linear regression models provide a framework for summarizing highly complex, multivariate data. Because this framework requires only linearity in the parameters, we are able to fit models that are nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables, thus providing a wide scope of potential applications. 3.1 Method of Least Squares 3.1.1 Least Squares Method Chapter 2 dealt with the problem of a response depending on a single explanatory variable. We now extend the focus of that chapter and study how a response may depend on several explanatory variables. Example: Term Life Insurance. Like all firms, life insurance companies continually seek new ways to deliver products to the market. Those involved in product development wish to know “who buys insurance and how much do they buy?” In economics, this is known as the demand side of a market for products. Analysts can readily get information on characteristics of current customers through company databases. Potential customers, those that do not have insurance with the company, are often the main focus for expanding market share. In this example, we examine the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally representative sample that contains extensive information on assets, liabilities, income, and demographic characteristics of those sampled (potential U.S. customers). We study a random sample of 500 households with positive incomes that were interviewed in the 2004 survey. We initially consider the subset of \\(n=275\\) families that purchased term life insurance. We wish to address the second portion of the demand question and determine family characteristics that influence the amount of insurance purchased. Chapter 11 will consider the first portion, whether or not a household purchases insurance, through models where the response is a binary random variable. For term life insurance, the quantity of insurance is measured by the policy FACE, the amount that the company will pay in the event of the death of the named insured. Characteristics that will turn out to be important include annual INCOME, the number of years of EDUCATION of the survey respondent, and the number of household members, NUMHH. 3.1.2 General Case with \\(k\\) Explanatory Variables In general, we will consider data sets where there are \\(k\\) explanatory variables and one response variable in a sample of size \\(n\\). That is, the data consist of: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} x_{11},x_{12},\\ldots,x_{1k},y_1 \\\\ x_{21},x_{22},\\ldots,x_{2k},y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1},x_{n2},\\ldots,x_{nk},y_n \\end{aligned} \\right\\}. \\] The \\(i\\)th observation corresponds to the \\(i\\)th row, consisting of \\((x_{i1},x_{i2},\\ldots,x_{ik},y_i)\\). For this general case, we take \\(k+1\\) measurements on each entity. For the insurance demand example, \\(k=3\\) and the data consists of \\((x_{11},x_{12},x_{13}, y_1), \\ldots , (x_{275,1},x_{275,2},x_{275,3},y_{275})\\). That is, we use four measurements from each of the \\(n=275\\) households. Summarizing the Data We begin the data analysis by examining each variable in isolation from the others. Table 3.1 provides basic summary statistics of the four variables. For FACE and INCOME, we see that the mean is much greater than the median, suggesting that the distribution is skewed to the right. Histograms (not reported here) show that this is the case. It will turn out to be useful to also consider their logarithmic transforms, LNFACE and LNINCOME, respectively, which are also reported in Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Term Life Summary Statistics Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum FACE 747,581 150,000 1,674,362 800 14,000,000 INCOME 208,975 65,000 824,010 260 10,000,000 EDUCATION 14.524 16 2.549 2 17 NUMHH 2.96 3 1.493 1 9 LNFACE 11.99 11.918 1.871 6.685 16.455 LNINCOME 11.149 11.082 1.295 5.561 16.118 The next step is to measure the relationship between each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), beginning with the scatter plots in Figure 3.1. The left-hand panel is a plot of FACE versus INCOME; in this panel, we see a large clustering in the lower left-hand corner corresponding to households that have both small incomes and face amounts of insurance. Both variables have skewed distributions and their joint effect is highly nonlinear. The right-hand panel presents the same variables but using logarithmic transforms. Here, we see a relationship that can be more readily approximated with a line. Figure 3.1: Income versus Face Amount of Term Life Insurance. The left-panel is a plot of face versus income, showing a highly nonlinear pattern. In the right-hand panel, face versus income is in natural logarithmic units, suggesting a linear (although variable) pattern.

It is difficult to produce a graph of observations in three or more dimensions on a two-dimensional platform, such as a piece of paper, that is not confusing, misleading, or both. To summarize graphically multivariate data in regression applications, consider using a scatterplot matrix such as in Figure 3.2. Each square of this figure represents a simple plot of one variable versus another. For each square, the row variable gives the units of the vertical axis and the column variable gives the units of the horizontal axis. The matrix is sometimes called a half scatterplot matrix because only the lower left-hand elements are presented. Figure 3.2: Scatterplot matrix of four variables. Each square is a scatter plot. The scatterplot matrix can be numerically summarized using a correlation matrix. Each correlation in Table 3.2 corresponds to a square of the scatterplot matrix in Figure 3.2. Analysts often present tables of correlations because they are easy to interpret. However, remember that a correlation coefficient merely measures the extent of linear relationships. Thus, a table of correlations provides a sense of linear relationships but may miss a nonlinear relationship that can be revealed in a scatterplot matrix.

It seems reasonable to investigate the joint effect of these variables on a response. The geometric concept of a plane is used to explore the linear relationship between a response and several explanatory variables. Recall that a plane extends the concept of a line to more than two dimensions. A plane may be defined through an algebraic equation such as \\[ y = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + \\ldots + b_k x_k. \\] This equation defines a plane in \\(k+1\\) dimensions. Figure 3.3 shows a plane in three dimensions. For this figure, there is one response variable, LNFACE, and two explanatory variables, EDUCATION and LNINCOME (NUMHH is held fixed). It is difficult to graph more than three dimensions in a meaningful way. Figure 3.3: An example of a three-dimensional plane We need a way to determine a plane based on the data. The difficulty is that in most regression analysis applications, the number of observations, \\(n\\), far exceeds the number of observations required to fit a plane, \\(k+1\\). Thus, it is generally not possible to find a single plane that passes through all \\(n\\) observations. As in Chapter 2, we use the method of least squares to determine a plane from the data. The method of least squares is based on determining the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast}\\) that minimize the quantity \\[ SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_{i1}+\\ldots+b_k^{\\ast}x_{ik}\\right) \\right) ^2. \\tag{3.1} \\] We drop the asterisk, or star, notation and use \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_k\\) to denote the best values, known as the least squares estimates. With the least squares estimates, define the least squares, or fitted, regression plane as \\[ \\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + \\ldots + b_k x_k. \\] The least squares estimates are determined by minimizing \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast})\\). It is difficult to write down the resulting least squares estimators using a simple formula unless one resorts to matrix notation. Because of their importance in applied statistical models, an explicit formula for the estimators is provided below. However, these formulas have been programmed into a wide variety of statistical and spreadsheet software packages. The availability of these packages allows data analysts to concentrate on the ideas of the estimation procedure instead of focusing on the details of the calculation procedures. As an example, a regression plane was fit to the Term Life data where three explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\) for EDUCATION, \\(x_2\\) for NUMHH, and \\(x_3\\) for LNINCOME, were used. The resulting fitted regression plane is \\[ \\widehat{y} = 2.584 + 0.206 x_1 + 0.306 x_2 + 0.494 x_3. \\tag{3.2} \\] Matrix Notation Assume that the data are of the form \\((x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}, y_i)\\), where \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\). Here, the variable \\(x_{i0}\\) is associated with the “intercept” term. In most applications, we assume that \\(x_{i0}\\) is identically equal to 1 and thus need not be explicitly represented. However, there are important applications where this is not the case, and thus, to express the model in general notation, it is included here. The data are represented in matrix notation using: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix} ~~\\text{and}~~ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{10} &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1k} \\\\ x_{20} &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n0} &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{nk} \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the \\(n \\times 1\\) vector of responses and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the \\(n \\times (k+1)\\) matrix of explanatory variables. We use the matrix algebra convention that lower and upper case bold letters represent vectors and matrices, respectively. (If you need to brush up on matrices, review Section 2.11.) Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. Recall that \\(y\\) represents the logarithmic face, \\(x_1\\) for years of education, \\(x_2\\) for the number of household members, and \\(x_3\\) for logarithmic income. Thus, there are \\(k = 3\\) explanatory variables and \\(n = 275\\) households. The vector of responses and the matrix of explanatory variables are: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{275} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9.904 \\\\ 11.775 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 9.210 \\end{pmatrix} ~~\\text{and}~~ \\\\ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; x_{13} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; x_{23} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{275,1} &amp; x_{275,2} &amp; x_{275,3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 16 &amp; 3 &amp; 10.669 \\\\ 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 &amp; 9.393 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; 12 &amp; 1 &amp; 10.545 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] For example, for the first observation in the data set, the dependent variable is \\(y_1 = 9.904\\) (corresponding to \\(\\exp(9.904) = \\$20,000\\)), for a survey respondent with 16 years of education living in a household with 3 people and a logarithmic income of 10.669 (\\(\\exp(10.669) = \\$43,000\\)). Under the least squares estimation principle, our goal is to choose the coefficients \\(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}\\) to minimize the sum of squares function \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})\\). Using calculus, we return to the equation for the sum of squares, take partial derivatives with respect to each coefficient, and set these quantities equal to zero: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_j^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( -2x_{ij}\\right) \\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_{i1}+\\ldots+b_k^{\\ast}x_{ik}\\right) \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 0, ~~~ \\text{for} ~ j=0,1,\\ldots,k. \\end{array} \\] This is a system of \\(k+1\\) equations and \\(k+1\\) unknowns that can be readily solved using matrix notation, as follows. We may express the vector of parameters to be minimized as \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}=(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})^{\\prime}\\). Using this, the sum of squares can be written as \\(SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = (\\mathbf{y-Xb}^{\\ast})^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{y-Xb}^{\\ast})\\). Thus, in matrix form, the solution to the minimization problem can be expressed as \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}} SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{0}\\). This solution satisfies the normal equations: \\[ \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}Xb} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}. \\tag{3.3} \\] Here, the asterisk notation (*) has been dropped to denote the fact that \\(\\mathbf{b} = (b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_k)^{\\prime}\\) represents the best vector of values in the sense of minimizing \\(SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast})\\) over all choices of \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\). The least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) need not be unique. However, assuming that the explanatory variables are not linear combinations of one another, we have that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) is invertible. In this case, we can write the unique solution as: \\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{3.4} \\] To illustrate, for the Term Life example, equation (3.4) yields: \\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.584 \\\\ 0.206 \\\\ 0.306 \\\\ 0.494 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}. \\] 3.2 Linear Regression Model and Properties of Estimators In the previous section, we learned how to use the method of least squares to fit a regression plane with a data set. This section describes the assumptions underpinning the regression model and some of the resulting properties of the regression coefficient estimators. With the model and the fitted data, we will be able to draw inferences about the sample data set to a larger population. Moreover, we will later use these regression model assumptions to help us improve the model specification in Chapter 5. 3.2.1 Regression Function Most of the assumptions of the multiple linear regression model will carry over directly from the basic linear regression model assumptions introduced in Section 2.2. The primary difference is that we now summarize the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables through the regression function: \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 x_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k, \\tag{3.5} \\] which is linear in the parameters \\(\\beta_0,\\ldots,\\beta_k\\). Henceforth, we will use \\(x_0 = 1\\) for the variable associated with the parameter \\(\\beta_0\\); this is the default in most statistical packages, and most applications of regression include the intercept term \\(\\beta_0\\). The intercept is the expected value of \\(y\\) when all of the explanatory variables are equal to zero. Although rarely of interest, the term \\(\\beta_0\\) serves to set the height of the fitted regression plane. In contrast, the other betas are typically important parameters from a regression study. To help interpret them, we initially assume that \\(x_j\\) varies continuously and is not related to the other explanatory variables. Then, we can interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) as the expected change in \\(y\\) per unit change in \\(x_j\\) assuming all other explanatory variables are held fixed. That is, from calculus, you will recognize that \\(\\beta_j\\) can be interpreted as a partial derivative. Specifically, using the equation above, we have that \\[ \\beta_j = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_j}\\mathrm{E}~y. \\] 3.2.2 Regression Coefficient Interpretation Let us examine the regression coefficient estimates from the Term Life Insurance example and focus initially on the sign of the coefficients. For example, from equation (3.4), the coefficient associated with NUMHH is \\(b_2 = 0.306 &gt; 0\\). If we consider two households that have the same income and the same level of education, then the larger household (in terms of NUMHH) is expected to demand more term life insurance under the regression model. This is a sensible interpretation; larger households have more dependents for which term life insurance can provide needed financial assets in the event of the untimely death of a breadwinner. The positive coefficient associated with income (\\(b_3 = 0.494\\)) is also plausible; households with larger incomes have more disposable dollars to purchase insurance. The positive sign associated with EDUCATION (\\(b_1 = 0.206)\\) is also reasonable; more education suggests that respondents are more aware of their insurance needs, other things being equal. You will also need to interpret the amount of the regression coefficient. Consider first the EDUCATION coefficient. Using equation (3.4), fitted values of \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) were calculated by allowing EDUCATION to vary and keeping NUMHH and LNINCOME fixed at the sample averages. The results are: Effects of Small Changes in Education EDUCATION 14 14.1 14.2 14.3 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{LNFACE}}\\) 11.883 11.904 11.924 11.945 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) 144,803 147,817 150,893 154,034 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change 2.081 2.081 2.081 As EDUCATION increases, \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) increases. Further, the amount of \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) increase is a constant 0.0206. This comes directly from equation (3.4); as EDUCATION increases by 0.1 years, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 0.0206 logarithmic dollars, holding NUMHH and LNINCOME fixed. This interpretation is correct, but most product development directors are not overly fond of logarithmic dollars. To return to dollars, fitted face values can be calculated through exponentiation as \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{FACE}} = \\exp(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}})\\). Moreover, the percentage change can be computed; for example, \\(100 \\times (147,817/144,803 - 1) \\approx 2.08\\%\\). This provides another interpretation of the regression coefficient; as EDUCATION increases by 0.1 years, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 2.08%. This is a simple consequence of calculus using \\(\\partial \\ln y / \\partial x = \\left(\\partial y / \\partial x \\right) / y\\); that is, a small change in the logarithmic value of \\(y\\) equals a small change in \\(y\\) as a proportion of \\(y\\). It is because of this calculus result that we use natural logs instead of common logs in regression analysis. Because this table uses a discrete change in EDUCATION, the 2.08% differs slightly from the continuous result \\(0.206 \\times (\\mathrm{change~in~EDUCATION}) = 2.06\\%\\). However, this proximity is usually regarded as suitable for interpretation purposes. Continuing this logic, consider small changes in logarithmic income. Effects of Small Changes in Logarithmic Income LNINCOME 11 11.1 11.2 11.3 INCOME 59,874 66,171 73,130 80,822 INCOME % Change 10.52 10.52 10.52 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{LNFACE}}\\) 11.957 12.006 12.055 12.105 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) 155,831 163,722 172,013 180,724 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change 5.06 5.06 5.06 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change / INCOME % Change 0.482 0.482 0.482 We can use the same logic to interpret the LNINCOME coefficient in equation (3.4). As logarithmic income increases by 0.1 units, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 5.06%. This takes care of logarithmic units in the \\(y\\) but not the \\(x\\). We can use the same logic to say that as logarithmic income increases by 0.1 units, INCOME increases by 10.52%. Thus, a 10.52% change in INCOME corresponds to a 5.06% change in FACE. Summarizing, we say that, holding NUMHH and EDUCATION fixed, we expect that a 1% increase in INCOME is associated with a 0.482% increase in \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{FACE}}\\) (as before, this is close to the parameter estimate \\(b_3 = 0.494\\)). The coefficient associated with income is known as an elasticity in economics. In economics, elasticity is the ratio of the percent change in one variable to the percent change in another variable. Mathematically, we summarize this as: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\ln y}{\\partial \\ln x} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{y}\\right)/\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{x}\\right). \\] 3.2.3 Model Assumptions As in Section 2.2 for a single explanatory variable, there are two sets of assumptions that one can use for multiple linear regression. They are equivalent sets, each having comparative advantages as we proceed in our study of regression. The “observables” representation focuses on variables of interest \\((x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}, y_i)\\). The “error representation” provides a springboard for motivating our goodness of fit measures and study of residual analysis. However, the latter set of assumptions focuses on the additive errors case and obscures the sampling basis of the model. \\[ \\textbf{Multiple Linear Regression Model Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Observables Representation} &amp; \\text{Error Representation} \\\\ \\hline F1.~ \\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_k x_{ik}. &amp; E1.~ y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_k x_{ik}+\\varepsilon_i. \\\\ F2.~ \\{x_{i1},\\ldots ,x_{ik}\\} &amp; E2.~ \\{x_{i1},\\ldots ,x_{ik}\\} \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{are non-stochastic variables.} &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{are non-stochastic variables.} \\\\ F3.~ \\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma^2. &amp; E3.~ \\mathrm{E}~\\varepsilon_i=0 \\text{ and } \\mathrm{Var}~\\varepsilon_i=\\sigma^2. \\\\ F4.~ \\{y_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables.} &amp; E4.~ \\{\\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables.} \\\\ F5.~ \\{y_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed.} &amp; E5.~ \\{\\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed.} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] To further motivate Assumptions F2 and F4, we will usually assume that our data have been realized as the result of a stratified sampling scheme, where each unique value of \\(\\{x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\}\\) is treated as a stratum. That is, for each value of \\(\\{x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\}\\), we draw a random sample of responses from a population. Thus, responses within each stratum are independent from one another, as are responses from different strata. Chapter 6 will discuss this sampling basis in further detail. 3.2.4 Properties of Regression Coefficient Estimators Section 3.1 described the least squares method for estimating regression coefficients. With the regression model assumptions, we can establish some basic properties of these estimators. To do this, from Section 2.11.4 we have that the expectation of a vector is the vector of expectations, so that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = \\left( \\begin{array}{l} \\mathrm{E}~y_1 \\\\ \\mathrm{E}~y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E}~y_n \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Further, basic matrix multiplication shows that \\[ \\small{ \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1k} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{11} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{1k} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{21} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{n1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . } \\] Because the \\(i\\)th row of assumption F1 is \\(\\mathrm{E}~y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik}\\), we may re-write this assumption in matrix formulation as \\(\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\). We are now in a position to state the first important property of least squares regression estimators. Property 1. Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is an unbiased estimator of the parameter vector \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). To establish Property 1, we have that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{b} = \\mathrm{E}~\\left((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\right) = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) = \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\] using matrix multiplication rules. This chapter assumes that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) is invertible. One can also show that the least squares estimator need only be a solution of the normal equations for unbiasedness (not requiring that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) be invertible, see Section 4.7.3). Thus, \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). In particular, \\(\\mathrm{E}~b_j = \\beta_j\\) for \\(j = 0,1,\\ldots,k\\). Because independence implies zero covariance, from Assumption F4 we have that \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i,y_j) = 0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\). From this, Assumption F3 and the definition of the variance of a vector, we have that \\[ \\small{ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{y} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var~}y_1 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1,y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1,y_n) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2,y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2,y_n) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n,y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n,y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}y_n \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\sigma^2 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\sigma^2 \\end{array} \\right) = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}, } \\] where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix. We are now in a position to state the second important property of least squares regression estimators. Property 2. Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) has variance \\(\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b} = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). To establish Property 2, we have that \\[ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b} = \\mathrm{Var}\\left((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\left[ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\right] \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{y}\\right) \\left[\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\right] \\\\ = \\left[ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\right] \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\left[\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\right] = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}, \\] as required. This important property will allow us to measure the precision of the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) when we discuss statistical inference. Specifically, by the definition of the variance of a vector (see Section 2.11.4), \\[ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}= \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{Var~}b_0 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_1) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_k) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(b_1,b_0) &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}b_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_1,b_k) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(b_k,b_0) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_k,b_1) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}b_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\sigma^2 (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}. \\tag{3.6} \\] Thus, for example, \\(\\mathrm{Var~}b_j\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the \\((j+1)\\)st diagonal entry of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). As another example, \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_j)\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the element in the first row and \\((j+1)\\)st column of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). Although alternative methods are available that are preferable for specific applications, the least squares estimators have proven to be effective for many routine data analyses. One desirable characteristic of least squares regression estimators is summarized in the following well-known result. Gauss-Markov Theorem: Consider the regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, within the class of estimators that are linear functions of the responses, the least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is the minimum variance unbiased estimator of the parameter vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). The Gauss-Markov theorem states that the least squares estimator is the most precise in the sense that it has the smallest variance. We have already seen in Property 1 that the least squares estimators are unbiased. The Gauss-Markov theorem states that the least squares estimator is the most precise in the sense that it has the smallest variance. (In a matrix context, “minimum variance” means that if \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\) is any other estimator, then the difference of the variance matrices, \\(\\mathrm{Var~} \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast} - \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}\\), is nonnegative definite.) An additional important property concerns the distribution of the least squares regression estimators. Property 3: Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F5 hold. Then, the least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is normally distributed. To establish Property 3, we define the weight vectors, \\(\\mathbf{w}_i = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}(1, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\). With this notation, we note that \\[ \\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{w}_i y_i, \\] so that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of responses. With Assumption F5, the responses are normally distributed. Because linear combinations of normally distributed random variables are normally distributed, we have the conclusion of Property 3. This result underpins much of the statistical inference that will be presented in Sections 3.4 and 4.2. 3.3 Estimation and Goodness of Fit Residual Standard Deviation Additional properties of the regression coefficient estimators will be discussed when we focus on statistical inference. We now continue our estimation discussion by providing an estimator of the other parameter in the linear regression model, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Our estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\) can be developed using the principle of replacing theoretical expectations by sample averages. Examining \\(\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{E}\\left( y-\\mathrm{E~}y\\right)^2\\), replacing the outer expectation by a sample average suggests using the estimator \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\mathrm{E~}y_i)^2\\). Because we do not observe \\(\\mathrm{E}~y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik}\\), we use in its place the corresponding observed quantity \\(b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_k x_{ik} = \\widehat{y}_i\\). This leads to the following. Definition. An estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), the mean square error (MSE), is defined as \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-(k+1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)^2. \\tag{3.7} \\] The positive square root, \\(s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\), is called the residual standard deviation. This expression generalizes the definition in equation (2.3), which is valid for \\(k=1\\). It turns out, by using \\(n-(k+1)\\) instead of \\(n\\) in the denominator of equation (3.7), that \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). Essentially, by using \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) instead of \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i\\) in the definition, we have introduced some small dependencies among the deviations from the responses \\(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\), thus reducing the overall variability. To compensate for this lower variability, we also reduce the denominator in the definition of \\(s^2\\). To provide further intuition on the choice of \\(n-(k+1)\\) in the definition of \\(s^2\\), we introduced the concept of residuals in the context of multiple linear regression. From Assumption E1, recall that the random errors can be expressed as \\(\\varepsilon_i = y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik})\\). Because the parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_k\\) are not observed, the errors themselves are not observed. Instead, we examine the “estimated errors,” or residuals, defined by \\(e_i = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\). Unlike errors, there exist certain dependencies among the residuals. One dependency is due to the algebraic fact that the average residual is zero. Further, there must be at least \\(k+2\\) observations for there to be variation in the fit of the plane. If we have only \\(k+1\\) observations, we could fit a plane to the data perfectly, resulting in no variation in the fit. For example, if \\(k=1\\), because two observations determine a line, then at least three observations are required to observe any deviation from the line. Because of these dependencies, we have only \\(n-(k+1)\\) free, or unrestricted, residuals to estimate the variability about the regression plane. The positive square root of \\(s^2\\) is our estimator of \\(\\sigma\\). Using residuals, it can be expressed as \\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-(k+1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}. \\tag{3.8} \\] Because it is based on residuals, we refer to \\(s\\) as the residual standard deviation. The quantity \\(s\\) is a measure of our “typical error.” For this reason, \\(s\\) is also called the standard error of the estimate. The Coefficient of Determination: \\(R^2\\) To summarize the goodness of fit of the model, as in Chapter 2 we partition the variability into pieces that are “explained” and “unexplained” by the regression fit. Algebraically, the calculations for regression using many variables are similar to the case of using only one variable. Unfortunately, when dealing with many variables, we do lose the easy graphical interpretation such as in Figure 2.4. Begin with the total sum of squared deviations, \\(Total~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2\\), as our measure of the total variation in the data set. As in equation (2.1), we may then interpret the equation \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\underbrace{y_i - \\overline{y}} &amp; = &amp; \\underbrace{y_i - \\widehat{y}_i} &amp; + &amp; \\underbrace{\\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y}} \\\\ \\text{total} &amp; = &amp; \\text{unexplained} &amp; + &amp; \\text{explained} \\\\ \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} \\end{array} } \\] as the “deviation without knowledge of the explanatory variables equals the deviation not explained by the explanatory variables plus deviation explained by the explanatory variables.” Squaring each side and summing over all observations yields \\[ Total~SS = Error~SS + Regression~SS \\] where \\(Error~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)^2\\) and \\(Regression~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2\\). As in Section 2.3 for the one explanatory variable case, the sum of the cross-product terms turns out to be zero. A statistic that summarizes this relationship is the coefficient of determination, \\[ R^2 = \\frac{Regression~SS}{Total~SS}. \\] We interpret \\(R^2\\) to be the proportion of variability explained by the regression function. If the model is a desirable one for the data, one would expect a strong relationship between the observed responses and those “expected” under the model, the fitted values. An interesting algebraic fact is the following. If one squares the correlation coefficient between the responses and the fitted values, we get the coefficient of determination, that is, \\[ R^2 = \\left[ r \\left(y, \\widehat{y} \\right) \\right]^2. \\] As a result, \\(R\\), the positive square root of \\(R^2\\), is called the multiple correlation coefficient. It can be interpreted as the correlation between the response and the best linear combination of the explanatory variables, the fitted values. (This relationship is developed using matrix algebra in the technical supplement Section 5.10.1.) The variability decomposition is also summarized using the analysis of variance, or ANOVA, table, as follows. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|lcl} \\hline \\text{Source} &amp; \\text{Sum of Squares} &amp; df &amp; \\text{Mean Square} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Regression} &amp; Regression~SS &amp; k &amp; Regression~MS \\\\ \\text{Error} &amp; Error~SS &amp; n - (k + 1) &amp; MSE \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; Total~SS &amp; n - 1 &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] The mean square column figures are defined to be the sum of squares figures divided by their respective degrees of freedom. The error degrees of freedom denotes the number of unrestricted residuals. It is this number that we use in our definition of the “average,” or mean, square error. That is, we define \\[ MSE = Error~MS = \\frac{Error~SS}{n - (k + 1)} = s^2. \\] Similarly, the regression degrees of freedom is the number of explanatory variables. This yields \\[ Regression~MS = \\frac{Regression~SS}{k}. \\] When discussing the coefficient of determination, it can be established that whenever an explanatory variable is added to the model, \\(R^2\\) never decreases. This is true whether or not the additional variable is useful. We would like a measure of fit that decreases when useless variables are entered into the model as explanatory variables. To circumvent this anomaly, a widely used statistic is the coefficient of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom, defined by \\[ R_{a}^2 = 1 - \\frac{(Error~SS) / [n - (k + 1)]}{(Total~SS) / (n - 1)} = 1 - \\frac{s^2}{s_{y}^2}. \\tag{3.9} \\] To interpret this statistic, note that \\(s_y^2\\) does not depend on the model nor the model variables. Thus, \\(s^2\\) and \\(R_a^2\\) are equivalent measures of model fit. As the model fit improves, then \\(R_{a}^2\\) becomes larger and \\(s^2\\) becomes smaller, and vice versa. Put another way, choosing a model with the smallest \\(s^2\\) is equivalent to choosing a model with the largest \\(R_a^2\\). Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. To illustrate, Table 3.3 displays the summary statistics for the regression of LNFACE on EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME. From the degrees of freedom column, we remind ourselves that there are three explanatory variables and 275 observations. As measures of model fit, the coefficient of determination is \\(R^2 = 34.3\\%\\) (=\\(328.47 / 958.90\\)) and the residual standard deviation is \\(s = 1.525\\) (=\\(\\sqrt{2.326}\\)). If we were to attempt to estimate the logarithmic face amount without knowledge of the explanatory variables EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME, then the size of the typical error would be \\(s_y = 1.871\\) (=\\(\\sqrt{958.90 / 274}\\)). Thus, by taking advantage of our knowledge of the explanatory variables, we have been able to reduce the size of the typical error. The measure of model fit that compares these two estimates of variability is the adjusted coefficient of determination, \\(R_a^2 = 1 - 2.326 / 1.871^2 = 33.6\\%\\). Table 3.3: Term Life ANOVA Table Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square Regression 328.47 3 109.49 Error 630.43 271 2.326 Total 958.9 274 Example: Why do Females Live Longer than Males? In an article with this title, Lemaire (2002) examined what he called the “female advantage,” the difference in life expectancy between females and males. Life expectancies are of interest because they are widely used measures of a nation’s health. Lemaire examined data from \\(n = 169\\) countries and found that the average female advantage was 4.51 years worldwide. He sought to explain this difference based on 45 behavioral measures, variables that capture a nation’s degree of economic modernization, social/cultural/religious mores, geographic position, and quality of health care available. After a detailed analysis, Lemaire reports coefficients from a regression model that appear in Table 3.4. This regression model explains \\(R^2 = 61\\%\\) of the variability. It is a parsimonious model consisting of only \\(k = 4\\) of the original 45 variables. Table 3.4. Regression Coefficients from a Model of Female Advantage \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|rr} \\hline \\text{Variable} &amp; \\text{Coefficient} &amp; t\\text{-statistic} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Intercept} &amp; 9.904 &amp; 12.928 \\\\ \\text{Logarithmic Number of Persons per Physician} &amp; -0.473 &amp; -3.212 \\\\ \\text{Fertility} &amp; -0.444 &amp; -3.477 \\\\ \\text{Percentage of Hindus and Buddhists} &amp; -0.018 &amp; -3.196 \\\\ \\text{Soviet Union Dummy} &amp; 4.922 &amp; 7.235 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Source: Lemaire (2002) All variables were strongly statistically significant. The number of persons per physician was also correlated with other variables that capture a country’s degree of economic modernization, such as urbanization, number of cars, and the percentage working in agriculture. Fertility, the number of births per woman, was highly correlated with education variables in the study, including female illiteracy and female school enrollment. The percentage of Hindus and Buddhists is a social/cultural/religious variable. The Soviet Union dummy is a geographic variable - it characterizes Eastern European countries that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. Because of the high degree of collinearity among the 45 candidate variables, other analysts could easily pick an alternative set of variables. Nonetheless, Lemaire’s important point was that this simple model explains roughly 61% of the variability based on only behavioral variables, unrelated to biological sex differences. 3.4 Statistical Inference for a Single Coefficient 3.4.1 The t-Test In many applications, a single variable is of primary interest, and other variables are included in the regression to control for additional sources of variability. To illustrate, a sales agent might be interested in the effect that income has on the quantity of insurance demanded. In a regression analysis, one could also include other explanatory variables such as an individual’s gender, type of occupation, age, size of the household, education level, and so on. By including these additional explanatory variables, we hope to gain a better understanding of the relationship between income and insurance demand. To reach sensible conclusions, we will need some rules to decide whether a variable is important or not. We respond to the question “Is \\(x_j\\) important?” by investigating whether or not the corresponding slope parameter, \\(\\beta_j\\), equals zero. The question is whether \\(\\beta_j\\) is zero can be restated in the hypothesis testing framework as “Is \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\) valid?” We examine the proximity of \\(b_j\\) to zero in order to determine whether or not \\(\\beta_j\\) is zero. Because the units of \\(b_j\\) depend on the units of \\(y\\) and \\(x_j\\), we need to standardize this quantity. From Property 2 and equation (3.6), we saw that \\(\\mathrm{Var~}b_j\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the \\((j+1)^{st}\\) diagonal element of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1}\\). Replacing \\(\\sigma^2\\) by the estimator \\(s^2\\) and taking square roots, we have the following. Definition. The standard error of \\(b_j\\) can be expressed as \\[ se(b_j) = s \\sqrt{\\text{(j+1)st diagonal element of } (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1}}. \\] Recall that a standard error is an estimated standard deviation. To test \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\), we examine the \\(t\\)-ratio, \\(t(b_j) = \\frac{b_j}{se(b_j)}\\). We interpret \\(t(b_j)\\) to be the number of standard errors that \\(b_j\\) is away from zero. This is the appropriate quantity because the sampling distribution of \\(t(b_j)\\) can be shown to be the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom, under the null hypothesis with the linear regression model assumptions F1-F5. This enables us to construct tests of the null hypothesis such as the following procedure: Procedure. The t-test for a Regression Coefficient (\\(\\beta\\)). The null hypothesis is \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\). The alternative hypothesis is \\(H_{a}:\\beta_j \\neq 0\\). Establish a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) (typically but not necessarily 5%). Construct the statistic, \\(t(b_j) = \\frac{b_j}{se(b_j)}\\). Procedure: Reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if \\(|t(b_j)|\\) exceeds a \\(t\\)-value. Here, this \\(t\\)-value is the \\((1-\\alpha /2)^{th}\\) percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution using \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom, denoted as \\(t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}\\). In many applications, the sample size will be large enough so that we may approximate the \\(t\\)-value by the corresponding percentile from the standard normal curve. At the 5% level of significance, this percentile is 1.96. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we can interpret a variable to be important if its \\(t\\)-ratio exceeds two in absolute value. Although it is the most common, testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\) versus \\(H_{a}:\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) is just one of many hypothesis tests that can be performed. Table 3.5 outlines alternative decision-making procedures. These procedures are for testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j = d\\). Here, \\(d\\) is a user-prescribed value that may be equal to zero or any other known value. Table 3.5. Decision-Making Procedures for Testing \\(H_0: \\beta_j = d\\) \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\hline \\text{Alternative Hypothesis }(H_{a}) &amp; \\text{Procedure: Reject } H_0 \\text{ in favor of } H_a \\text{ if }\\\\ \\hline \\beta_j &gt; d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&gt;t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha } \\\\ \\beta_j &lt; d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&lt;-t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha } \\\\ \\beta_j\\neq d &amp; |t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}&gt;t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha/2} \\end{array} \\\\ \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline \\textit{Notes:} &amp;\\text{ The significance level is } \\alpha. \\text{ Here, } t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha}\\text{ is the }(1-\\alpha)^{th}\\text{ percentile} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{from the }t-\\text{distribution using } df=n-(k+1)\\text{ degrees of freedom.} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_j -d)/se(b_j) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Alternatively, one can construct \\(p\\)-values and compare these to given significant levels. The \\(p\\)-value allows the report reader to understand the strength of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Table 3.6 summarizes the procedure for calculating \\(p\\)-values. Table 3.6. Probability Values for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j =d\\) \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline \\text{Alternative} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Hypothesis} (H_a ) &amp; \\beta_j &gt; d &amp; \\beta_j &lt; d &amp; \\beta_j \\neq d \\\\ \\hline p-value &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-(k+1)}&gt;t-ratio) &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-(k+1)}&lt;t-ratio) &amp; \\Pr(|t_{n-(k+1)}|&gt;|t-ratio|) \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline \\textit{Notes:} &amp; \\text{ Here, } t_{n-(k+1)} \\text{ is a }t\\text{-distributed random variable with }df=n-(k+1)\\text{ degrees of freedom.} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_j -d)/se(b_j) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. A useful convention when reporting the results of a statistical analysis is to place the standard error of a statistic in parenthesis below that statistic. Thus, for example, in our regression of LNFACE on EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME, the estimated regression equation is: \\[ \\begin{array}{lccccc} \\widehat{LNFACE} = &amp;2.584 ~ + &amp;0.206~ \\text{EDUCATION} + &amp;0.306 ~\\text{NUMHH} + &amp;0.494 ~\\text{LNINCOME}. \\\\ \\text{std error} &amp;(0.846) &amp;(0.039) &amp;(0.063) &amp;(0.078). \\end{array} \\] To illustrate the calculation of the standard errors, first note that from Table 3.3 we have that the residual standard deviation is \\(s=1.525\\). Using a statistical package, we have \\[ \\small{ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.307975 &amp; -0.004633 &amp; -0.002131 &amp; -0.020697 \\\\ -0.004633 &amp; 0.000648 &amp; 0.000143 &amp; -0.000467 \\\\ -0.002131 &amp; 0.000143 &amp; 0.001724 &amp; -0.000453 \\\\ -0.020697 &amp; -0.000467 &amp; -0.000453 &amp; 0.002585 \\end{pmatrix}. } \\] To illustrate, we can compute \\(se(b_3)=s \\times \\sqrt{0.002585} = 0.078\\), as above. Calculation of the standard errors, as well as the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistics, is part of the standard output from statistical software and need not be computed by users. Our purpose here is to illustrate the ideas underlying the routine calculations. With this information, we can immediately compute \\(t\\)-ratios to check whether a coefficient associated with an individual variable is significantly different from zero. For example, the \\(t\\)-ratio for the LNINCOME variable is \\(t(b_3) = \\frac{0.494}{0.078} = 6.3\\). The interpretation is that \\(b_3\\) is over four standard errors above zero and thus LNINCOME is an important variable in the model. More formally, we may be interested in testing the null hypothesis that \\(H_0:\\beta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_0:\\beta_3 \\neq 0\\). At a 5% level of significance, the \\(t\\)-value is 1.96, because \\(df=275-(1+3)=271\\). We thus reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that logarithmic income (LNINCOME) is important in determining the logarithmic face amount. 3.4.2 Confidence Intervals Confidence intervals for parameters represent another device for describing the strength of the contribution of the \\(j\\)th explanatory variable. The statistic \\(b_j\\) is called a point estimate of the parameter \\(\\beta_j\\). To provide a range of reliability, we use the confidence interval: \\[ b_j \\pm t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}~se(b_j). \\tag{3.10} \\] Here, the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}\\) is a percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom. We use the same \\(t\\)-value as in the two-sided hypothesis test. Indeed, there is a duality between the confidence interval and the two-sided hypothesis test. For example, it is not hard to check that if a hypothesized value falls outside the confidence interval, then \\(H_0\\) will be rejected in favor of \\(H_{a}\\). Further, knowledge of the \\(p\\)-value, point estimate, and standard error can be used to determine a confidence interval. 3.4.3 Added Variable Plots To represent multivariate data graphically, we have seen that a scatterplot matrix is a useful device. However, the major shortcoming of the scatterplot matrix is that it only captures relationships between pairs of variables. When the data can be summarized using a regression model, a graphical device that does not have this shortcoming is an added variable plot. The added variable plot is also called a partial regression plot because, as we will see, it is constructed in terms of residuals from certain regression fits. We will also see that the added variable plot can be summarized in terms of a partial correlation coefficient, thus providing a link between correlation and regression. To introduce these ideas, we work in the context of the following example. Example: Refrigerator Prices. What characteristics of a refrigerator are important in determining its price (PRICE)? We consider here several characteristics of a refrigerator, including the size of the refrigerator in cubic feet (RSIZE), the size of the freezer compartment in cubic feet (FSIZE), the average amount of money spent per year to operate the refrigerator (ECOST, for “energy cost”), the number of shelves in the refrigerator and freezer doors (SHELVES), and the number of features (FEATURES). The features variable includes shelves for cans, see-through crispers, ice makers, egg racks, and so on. Both consumers and manufacturers are interested in models of refrigerator prices. Other things equal, consumers generally prefer larger refrigerators with lower energy costs that have more features. Due to forces of supply and demand, we would expect consumers to pay more for these refrigerators. A larger refrigerator with lower energy costs that has more features at a similar price is considered a bargain to the consumer. How much extra would the consumer be willing to pay for this additional space? A model of prices for refrigerators on the market provides some insight into this question. To this end, we analyze data from \\(n=37\\) refrigerators. Table 3.7 provides the basic summary statistics for the response variable PRICE and the five explanatory variables. From this table, we see that the average refrigerator price is \\(\\overline{y} = \\$626.40\\), with standard deviation \\(s_{y} = \\$139.80\\). Similarly, the average annual amount to operate a refrigerator, or average ECOST, is $70.51. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly.

From the table, we see that there are strong linear relationships between PRICE and each of freezer space (FSIZE) and the number of FEATURES. Surprisingly, there is also a strong positive correlation between PRICE and ECOST. Recall that ECOST is the energy cost; one might expect that higher-priced refrigerators should enjoy lower energy costs.

The fitted regression equation appears in Table 3.9, with \\(s=60.65\\) and \\(R^2=83.8\\%\\). Table 3.9: Fitted Refrigerator Price Model Coefficient Standard Error \\(t\\)-Ratio Intercept 798.00 271.400 -2.9 ECOST -6.96 2.275 -3.1 RSIZE 76.50 19.440 3.9 FSIZE 137.00 23.760 5.8 SHELVES 37.90 9.886 3.8 FEATURES 23.80 4.512 5.3 From Table 3.9, the explanatory variables seem to be useful predictors of refrigerator prices. Together, these variables account for 83.8% of the variability. For understanding prices, the typical error has dropped from \\(s_{y} = \\$139.80\\) to \\(s = \\$60.65\\). The \\(t\\)-ratios for each of the explanatory variables exceed two in absolute value, indicating that each variable is important on an individual basis. What is surprising about the regression fit is the negative coefficient associated with energy cost. Remember, we can interpret \\(b_{ECOST} = -6.96\\) to mean that, for each dollar increase in ECOST, we expect the PRICE to decrease by $6.96. This negative relationship conforms to our economic intuition. However, it is surprising that the same data set has shown us that there is a positive relationship between PRICE and ECOST. This seeming anomaly is because correlation only measures relationships between pairs of variables although the regression fit can account for several variables simultaneously. To provide more insight into this seeming anomaly, we now introduce the added variable plot. Producing an Added Variable Plot The added variable plot provides additional links between the regression methodology and more fundamental tools such as scatter plots and correlations. We work in the context of the Refrigerator Price Example to demonstrate the construction of this plot. Procedure for producing an added variable plot. Run a regression of PRICE on RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES, omitting ECOST. Compute the residuals from this regression, which we label \\(e_1\\). Run a regression of ECOST on RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. Compute the residuals from this regression, which we label \\(e_2\\). Plot \\(e_1\\) versus \\(e_2\\). This is the added variable plot of PRICE versus ECOST, controlling for the effects of the RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. This plot appears in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.4: An added variable plot. The residuals from the regression of PRICE on the explanatory variables, omitting ECOST, are on the vertical axis. On the horizontal axis are the residuals from the regression fit of ECOST on the other explanatory variables. The correlation coefficient is -0.48.

In many situations, this natural variation is small compared to the patterns evident in the nonrandom regression component. Thus, it is useful to think of the error, \\(\\varepsilon_i = y_i - \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_{ik} \\right)\\), as the response after controlling for the effects of the explanatory variables. In Section 3.3, we saw that a random error can be approximated by a residual, \\(e_i = y_i - \\left( b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + b_k x_{ik} \\right)\\). Thus, in the same way, we may think of a residual as the response after “controlling for” the effects of the explanatory variables. With this in mind, we can interpret the vertical axis of Figure 3.4 as the refrigerator PRICE controlled for effects of RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. Similarly, we can interpret the horizontal axis as the ECOST controlled for effects of RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. The plot then provides a graphical representation of the relation between PRICE and ECOST, after controlling for the other explanatory variables. For comparison, a scatter plot of PRICE and ECOST (not shown here) does not control for other explanatory variables. Thus, it is possible that the positive relationship between PRICE and ECOST is not due to a causal relationship but rather one or more additional variables that cause both variables to be large. For example, from Table 3.7, we see that the freezer size (FSIZE) is positively correlated with both ECOST and PRICE. It certainly seems reasonable that increasing the size of a freezer would cause both the energy cost and the price to increase. Rather, the positive correlation may be due to the fact that large values of FSIZE mean large values of both ECOST and PRICE. Variables left out of a regression are called omitted variables. This omission could cause a serious problem in a regression model fit; regression coefficients could be not only strongly significant when they should not be, but they may also be of the incorrect sign. Selecting the proper set of variables to be included in the regression model is an important task; it is the subject of Chapters 5 and 6. 3.4.4 Partial Correlation Coefficients As we saw in Chapter 2, a correlation statistic is a useful quantity for summarizing plots. The correlation for the added variable plot is called a partial correlation coefficient. It is defined to be the correlation between the residuals \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) and is denoted by \\(r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k)\\). Because it summarizes an added variable plot, we may interpret \\(r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k)\\) to be the correlation between \\(y\\) and \\(x_j\\), in the presence of the other explanatory variables. To illustrate, the correlation between PRICE and ECOST in the presence of the other explanatory variables is -0.48. The partial correlation coefficient can also be calculated using \\[ r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k) = \\frac{t(b_j)}{\\sqrt{t(b_j)^2 + n - (k + 1)}}. \\tag{3.11} \\] Here, \\(t(b_j)\\) is the \\(t\\)-ratio for \\(b_j\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\) (including the variable \\(x_j\\)). An important aspect of this equation is that it allows us to calculate partial correlation coefficients running only one regression. For example, from Table 3.9, the partial correlation between PRICE and ECOST in the presence of the other explanatory variables is \\(\\frac{-3.1}{\\sqrt{(-3.1)^2 + 37 - (5 + 1)}} \\approx -0.48\\). Calculation of partial correlation coefficients is quicker when using the relationship with the \\(t\\)-ratio, but may fail to detect nonlinear relationships. The information in Table 3.9 allows us to calculate all five partial correlation coefficients in the Refrigerator Price Example after running only one regression. The three-step procedure for producing added variable plots requires ten regressions, two for each of the five explanatory variables. Of course, by producing added variable plots, we can detect nonlinear relationships that are missed by correlation coefficients. Partial correlation coefficients provide another interpretation for \\(t\\)-ratios. The equation shows how to calculate a correlation statistic from a \\(t\\)-ratio, thus providing another link between correlation and regression analysis. Moreover, from the equation we see that the larger the \\(t\\)-ratio, the larger the partial correlation coefficient. That is, a large \\(t\\)-ratio means that there is a large correlation between the response and the explanatory variable, controlling for other explanatory variables. This provides a partial response to the question that is regularly asked by consumers of regression analyses, “Which variable is most important?” 3.5 Some Special Explanatory Variables The linear regression model is the basis of a rich family of models. This section provides several examples to illustrate the richness of this family. These examples demonstrate the use of (i) binary variables, (ii) transformation of explanatory variables, and (iii) interaction terms. This section also serves to underscore the meaning of the adjective linear in the phrase “linear regression”; the regression function is linear in the parameters but may be a highly nonlinear function of the explanatory variables. 3.5.1 Binary Variables Categorical variables provide a numerical label for measurements of observations that fall in distinct groups, or categories. Because of the grouping, categorical variables are discrete and generally take on a finite number of values. We begin our discussion with a categorical variable that can take on one of only two values, a binary variable. Further discussion of categorical variables is the topic of Chapter 4. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. We now consider the marital status of the survey respondent. In the Survey of Consumer Finances, respondents can select among several options describing their marital status including “married,” “living with a partner,” “divorced,” and so on. Marital status is not measured continuously but rather takes on values that fall into distinct groups. In this chapter, we group survey respondents according to whether or not they are single, defined to include those who are separated, divorced, widowed, never married, and are not married nor living with a partner. Chapter 4 will present a more complete analysis of marital status by including additional categories. The binary variable SINGLE is defined to be one if the survey respondent is single and 0 otherwise. The variable SINGLE is also known as an indicator variable because it indicates whether or not the respondent is single. Another name for this important type of variable is a dummy variable. We could use 0 and 100, or 20 and 36, or any other distinct values. However, 0 and 1 are convenient for the interpretation of the parameter values, discussed below. To streamline the discussion, we now present a model using only LNINCOME and SINGLE as explanatory variables. For our sample of \\(n = 275\\) households, 57 are single and the other 218 are not. To see the relationships among LNFACE, LNINCOME, and SINGLE, Figure 3.5 introduces a letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with SINGLE as the code variable. We can see that Figure 3.5 is a scatter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, using 50 randomly selected households from our sample of 275 (for clarity of the graph). However, instead of using the same plotting symbol for each observation, we have coded the symbols so that we can easily understand the behavior of a third variable, SINGLE. In other applications, you may elect to use other plotting symbols such as \\(\\clubsuit\\), \\(\\heartsuit\\), \\(\\spadesuit\\), and so on, or use different colors, to encode additional information. For this application, the letter codes “S” for single and “o” for other were selected because they remind the reader of the nature of the coding scheme. Regardless of the coding scheme, the important point is that a letter plot is a useful device for graphically portraying three or more variables in two dimensions. The main restriction is that the additional information must be categorized, such as with binary variables, to make the coding scheme work. Figure 3.5: Letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with the letter code ‘S’ for single and ‘o’ for other. The fitted regression lines have been superimposed. The lower line is for single and the upper line is for other. Figure 3.5 suggests that LNFACE is lower for those single than others for a given level of income. Thus, we now consider a regression model, LNFACE = β_0 + β_1 LNINCOME + β_2 SINGLE + ϵ. The regression function can be written as: \\[ \\text{E } y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; \\text{for other respondents} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_1 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; \\text{for single respondents} \\end{cases} \\] The interpretation of the model coefficients differs from the continuous variable case. For continuous variables such as LNINCOME, we interpret \\(\\beta_1\\) as the expected change in \\(y\\) per unit change of logarithmic income, holding other variables fixed. For binary variables such as SINGLE, we interpret \\(\\beta_2\\) as the expected increase in \\(y\\) when going from the base level of SINGLE (=0) to the alternative level. Thus, although we have one model for both marital statuses, we can interpret the model using two regression equations, one for each type of marital status. By writing a separate equation for each marital status, we have been able to simplify a complicated multiple regression equation. Sometimes, you will find it easier to communicate a series of simple relationships compared to a single, complex relationship. Although the interpretation for binary explanatory variables differs from the continuous, the ordinary least squares estimation method remains valid. To illustrate, the fitted version of the above model is \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cclll} \\widehat{LNFACE} &amp; = &amp; 5.09 &amp; + 0.634 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; - 0.800 \\text{SINGLE} .\\\\ \\text{std error} &amp; &amp; (0.89) &amp; ~~(0.078) &amp; ~(0.248) \\\\ \\end{array} } \\] To interpret \\(b_2 = -0.800\\), we say that we expect the logarithmic face to be smaller by 0.80 for a survey respondent who is single compared to the other category. This assumes that other things, such as income, remain unchanged. For a graphical interpretation, the two fitted regression lines are superimposed in Figure 3.5. 3.5.2 Transforming Explanatory Variables Regression models have the ability to represent complex, nonlinear relationships between the expected response and the explanatory variables. For example, early regression texts, such as Plackett (1960, Chapter 6), devote an entire chapter of material to polynomial regression, \\[ \\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x^p. \\tag{3.12} \\] Here, the idea is that a \\(p\\)th order polynomial in \\(x\\) can be used to approximate general, unknown nonlinear functions of \\(x\\). The modern-day treatment of polynomial regression does not require an entire chapter because the model in equation (3.12) can be expressed as a special case of the linear regression model. That is, with the regression function in equation (3.5), \\(\\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k\\), we can choose \\(k = p\\) and \\(x_1 =x\\), \\(x_2 = x^2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(x_p = x^p\\). Thus, with these choices of explanatory variables, we can model a highly nonlinear function of \\(x\\). We are not restricted to powers of \\(x\\) in our choice of transformations. For example, the model \\(\\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln x\\), provides another way to represent a gently sloping curve in \\(x\\). This model can be written as a special case of the basic linear regression model using \\(x^{\\ast} = \\ln x\\) as the transformed version of \\(x\\). Transformations of explanatory variables need not be smooth functions. To illustrate, in some applications, it is useful to categorize a continuous explanatory variable. For example, suppose that \\(x\\) represents the number of years of education, ranging from 0 to 17. If we are relying on information self-reported by our sample of senior citizens, there may be a substantial amount of error in the measurement of \\(x\\). We could elect to use a less informative, but more reliable, transform of \\(x\\) such as \\(x^{\\ast}\\), a binary variable for finishing 13 years of school (finishing high school). Formally, we would code \\(x^{\\ast} = 1\\) if \\(x \\geq 13\\) and \\(x^{\\ast} = 0\\) if \\(x &lt; 13\\). Thus, there are several ways that nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables can be used in the regression model. An example of a nonlinear regression model is \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\exp (\\beta_1 x) + \\varepsilon.\\) These typically arise in science applications of regressions where there are fundamental scientific principles guiding the complex model development. 3.5.3 Interaction Terms We have so far discussed how explanatory variables, say \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), affect the mean response in an additive fashion, that is, \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\). Here, we expect \\(y\\) to increase by \\(\\beta_1\\) per unit increase in \\(x_1\\), with \\(x_2\\) held fixed. What if the marginal rate of increase of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) differs for high values of \\(x_2\\) when compared to low values of \\(x_2\\)? One way to represent this is to create an interaction variable \\(x_3 = x_1 \\times x_2\\) and consider the model \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3\\). With this model, the change in the expected \\(y\\) per unit change in \\(x_1\\) now depends on \\(x_2\\). Formally, we can assess small changes in the regression function as: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{E}~y}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2 \\right) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 x_2 . \\] In this way, we may allow for more complicated functions of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Figure 3.6 illustrates this complex structure. From this figure and the above calculations, we see that the partial changes of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) due to movement of \\(x_1\\) depend on the value of \\(x_2\\). In this way, we say that the partial changes due to each variable are not unrelated but rather “move together.” Figure 3.6: Plot of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2\\) versus \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). More generally, an interaction term is a variable that is created as a nonlinear function of two or more explanatory variables. These special terms, even though permitting us to explore a rich family of nonlinear functions, can be cast as special cases of the linear regression model. To do this, we simply create the variable of interest and treat this new term as another explanatory variable. Of course, not every variable that we create will be useful. In some instances, the created variable will be so similar to variables already in our model that it will provide us with no new information. Fortunately, we can use \\(t\\)-tests to check whether the new variable is useful. Further, Chapter 4 will introduce a test to decide whether a group of variables is useful. The function that we use to create an interaction variable must be more than just a linear combination of other explanatory variables. For example, if we use \\(x_3 = x_1 + x_2\\), we will not be able to estimate all of the parameters. Chapter 5 will introduce some techniques to help avoid situations when one variable is a linear combination of the others. To give you some exposure to the wide variety of potential applications of special explanatory variables, we now present a series of short examples. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. How do we interpret the interaction of a binary variable with a continuous variable? To illustrate, consider a Term Life regression model, \\[ \\mathrm{LNFACE} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\mathrm{LNINCOME} + \\beta_2 \\mathrm{SINGLE} + \\beta_3 \\mathrm{LNINCOME*SINGLE} + \\varepsilon . \\] In this model, we have created a third explanatory variable through the interaction of LNINCOME and SINGLE. The regression function can be written as: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\mathrm{LNINCOME}, &amp; \\text{for other respondents}, \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) \\mathrm{LNINCOME}, &amp; \\text{for single respondents}. \\end{cases} \\] Thus, through this single model with four parameters, we can create two separate regression lines, one for those single and one for others. Figure 3.7 shows the two fitted regression lines for our data. Figure 3.7: Letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with the letter code S for single and o for other. The fitted regression lines have been superimposed. The lower line is for single and the upper line is for other. Example: Life Insurance Company Expenses. In a well-developed life insurance industry, minimizing expenses is critical for a company’s competitive position. Segal (2002) analyzed annual accounting data from over 100 firms for the period 1995-1998, inclusive, using a database from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and other reported information. Segal modeled overall company expenses as a function of firm outputs and the price of inputs. The outputs consist of insurance production, measured by \\(x_1\\) through \\(x_5\\), described in Table 3.10. Segal also considered the square of each output, as well as an interaction term with a dummy/binary variable \\(D\\) that indicates whether or not the firm uses a branch company to distribute its products. (In a branch company, field managers are company employees, not independent agents.)

The price of capital (\\(PC\\)) is approximated by the ratio of capital expense to the number of employees and agents, also in logarithmic units. The price of materials consists of expenses other than labor and capital divided by the number of policies sold and terminated during the year. It does not appear directly as an explanatory variable. Rather, Segal took the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) to be total company expenses divided by the price of materials, again in logarithmic units. With these variable definitions, Segal estimated the following regression function: \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y=\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^5 \\left( \\beta_j x_j + \\beta_{j+5} D x_j + \\beta_{j+10} x_j^2 + \\beta_{j+15}D x_j^2 \\right) + \\beta_{21} PL + \\beta_{22} PC. \\] The parameter estimates appear in Table 3.10. For example, the marginal change in \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) per unit change in \\(x_1\\) is: \\[ \\frac{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{E}~y}{\\partial x_1}= \\beta_1 + \\beta_{6} D + 2 \\beta_{11} x_1 + 2 \\beta_{16}D x_1, \\] which is estimated as $ -0.454 + 0.152 D + (0.064 - 0.014 D) x_1$. For these data, the median number of policies issued was \\(x_1=15,944\\). At this value of \\(x_1\\), the estimated marginal change is $ -0.454 + 0.152 D + (0.064 - 0.014 D) (15944) = 0.165 + 0.017 D,$ or 0.165 for baseline \\((D=0)\\) and 0.182 for branch \\((D=1)\\) companies. These estimates are elasticities, as defined in Section 3.2.2. To interpret these coefficients further, let \\(COST\\) represent total general company expenses and \\(NUMPOL\\) represent the number of life policies issued. Then, for branch \\((D=1)\\) companies, we have: \\[ 0.182 \\approx \\frac{\\partial y }{\\partial x_1 } = \\frac{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{ln}~COST}{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{ln}~NUMPOL}= \\frac{ \\frac{\\partial ~ COST}{\\partial ~NUMPOL}} {\\frac{COST}{NUMPOL}}, \\] or \\(\\frac{\\partial ~ COST}{\\partial ~NUMPOL} \\approx 0.182 \\frac{COST}{NUMPOL}\\). The median cost is $15,992,000, so the marginal cost per policy at these median values is \\(0.182 \\times (15992000/15944) = \\$182.55\\). Special Case: Curvilinear Response Functions We can expand the polynomial functions of an explanatory variable to include several explanatory variables. For example, the expected response, or response function, for a second-order model with two explanatory variables is: \\[ \\mathrm{E} y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2. \\] Figure 3.8 illustrates this response function. Similarly, the response function for a second-order model with three explanatory variables is: \\[ \\mathrm{E} y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{33} x_3^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \\beta_{13} x_1 x_3 + \\beta_{23} x_2 x_3. \\] When there is more than one explanatory variable, third and higher-order models are rarely used in applications. Figure 3.8: Plot of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1~x_1 + \\beta_2~x_2 + \\beta_{11}~x_1^2 + \\beta_{22}~x_2^2 + \\beta_{12}~x_1~x_2\\) versus \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).

For example, suppose that we are trying to model an individual’s charitable contributions (\\(y\\)) in terms of their wages (\\(x\\)). For 2007 data, a simple model we might entertain is given in Figure 3.9. Figure 3.9: The marginal change in \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) is lower below $97,500. The parameter \\(\\beta_2\\) represents the difference in the slopes. R Code to Produce Figure 3.9 # FIGURE 3.9 x &lt;- seq(90000,105000,20) Ey &lt;- 20 + 1*x + 2*(x-97500)*(x&gt;97500) par(mar=c(4.1,3.1,.1,1), cex=1.3) plot(x,Ey, type=&quot;l&quot;,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) mtext(&quot;E y&quot;, side=2,las=1, line=1.5,cex=1.1) text(102000,102000,expression(beta[1]+beta[2]),cex=1.1) text(94000,92000,expression(beta[1]),cex=1.1) A rationale for this model is that, in 2007, individuals paid 7.65% of their income for Social Security taxes up to 97,500. No Social Security taxes are excised on wages in excess of 97,500. Thus, one theory is that, for wages in excess of $97,500, individuals have more disposable income per dollar and thus should be more willing to make charitable contributions. To model this relationship, define the binary variable \\(z\\) to be zero if \\(x &lt; 97,500\\) and to be one if \\(x \\ge 97,500\\). Define the regression function to be \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z (x - 97,500)\\). This can be written as: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x &amp; x &lt; 97,500 \\\\ \\beta_0 - \\beta_2(97,500) + (\\beta_1+\\beta_2) x &amp; x \\geq 97,500 \\end{cases} \\] To estimate this model, we would run a regression of \\(y\\) on two explanatory variables, \\(x_1 = x\\) and \\(x_2 = z \\times (x - 97,500)\\). If \\(\\beta_2 &gt; 0\\), then the marginal rate of charitable contributions is higher for incomes exceeding $97,500. Figure 3.9 illustrates this relationship, known as piecewise linear regression or sometimes a “broken stick” model. The sharp break in Figure 3.9 at \\(x = 97,500\\) is called a “kink.” We have linear relationships above and below the kinks and have used a binary variable to put the two pieces together. We are not restricted to one kink. For example, suppose that we wish to do a historical study of Federal taxable income for 1992 single filers. Then, there were three tax brackets: the marginal tax rate below 21,450 was 15%, above 51,900 was 31%, and in between was 28%. For this example, we would use two kinks, at 21,450 and 51,900. Further, piecewise linear regression is not restricted to continuous response functions. For example, suppose that we are studying the commissions paid to stockbrokers (\\(y\\)) in terms of the number of shares purchased by a client (\\(x\\)). We might expect to see the relationship illustrated in Figure 3.10. Here, the discontinuity at \\(x = 100\\) reflects the administrative expenses of trading in odd lots, as trades of less than 100 shares are called. The lower marginal cost for trades in excess of 100 shares simply reflects the economies of scale for doing business in larger volumes. A regression model of this is \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z + \\beta_3 z x\\) where \\(z = 0\\) if \\(x &lt; 100\\) and \\(z = 1\\) if \\(x \\geq 100\\). The regression function depicted in Figure 3.10 is: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 &amp; x &lt; 100 \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + (\\beta_1+\\beta_3) x_1 &amp; x \\geq 100 \\end{cases} \\] Figure 3.10: Plot of expected commissions (\\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\)) versus number of shares traded (\\(x\\)). The break at \\(x=100\\) reflects savings in administrative expenses. The lower slope for \\(x \\ge 100\\) reflects economies of scales in expenses.

Nonlinear regression models are discussed in, for example, Bates and Watts (1988). Chapter 3 has introduced the fundamentals of multiple linear regression. Chapter 4 will widen the scope by introducing categorical variables and statistical inference methods for handling several coefficients simultaneously. Chapter 5 will introduce techniques to help you pick appropriate variables in a multiple linear regression model. Chapter 6 is a synthesis chapter, discussing model interpretation, variable selection and data collection. Chapter References Bates, Douglas M. and Watts, D. G. (1988).

Section 2.1 described a sample of \\(n=50\\) geographic areas (zip codes) containing sales data on the Wisconsin state lottery (\\(y = \\text{SALES}\\)). In that section, sales were analyzed using a basic linear regression model with \\(x = \\text{POP}\\), the area population, as the explanatory variable. This exercise extends that analysis by introducing additional explanatory variables given in Table 3.11. \\[ \\text{Table 3.11: Lottery, economic and demographic characteristics of fifty Wisconsin ZIP codes} \\] \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline \\textbf{Lottery characteristics} \\\\ \\hline \\text{SALES} &amp; \\text{Online lottery sales to individual consumers} \\\\ \\hline \\textbf{Economic and } \\\\ ~~~~~\\textbf{demographic characteristics} \\\\\\hline \\text{PERPERHH} &amp; \\text{Persons per household} \\\\ \\text{MEDSCHYR} &amp; \\text{Median years of schooling} \\\\ \\text{MEDHVL} &amp; \\text{Median home value in \\$1000s for owner-occupied homes} \\\\ \\text{PRCRENT} &amp; \\text{Percent of housing that is renter occupied} \\\\ \\text{PRC55P} &amp; \\text{Percent of population that is 55 or older} \\\\ \\text{HHMEDAGE} &amp; \\text{Household median age} \\\\ \\text{MEDINC} &amp; \\text{Estimated median household income, in \\$1000s} \\\\ \\text{POP} &amp; \\text{Population, in thousands} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Produce a table of summary statistics for all variables. One zip code (observation 11, zip = 53211, Shorewood Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee) appears to have unusually large values of MEDSCHYR and MEDHVL. For this observation, how many standard deviations is the value of MEDSCHYR above the mean? For this observation, how many standard deviations is the value of MEDHVL above the mean? Produce a table of correlations. What three variables are most highly correlated with SALES? Produce a scatter plot matrix of all explanatory variables and SALES. In the plot of MEDSCHYR versus SALES, describe the position of observation 11. Fit a linear model of SALES on all eight explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\) and its adjusted version, \\(R_a^2\\). Based on your part (d) model fit, is MEDSCHYR a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Now fit a more parsimonious model, using SALES as the dependent variable and MEDSCHYR, MEDHVL and POP as explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\) and its adjusted version, \\(R_a^2\\). How do these values compare to the model fit in part (d)? Note that the sign of the regression coefficient associated with MEDSCHYR is now negative. To help interpret this coefficient, compute the corresponding partial correlation coefficient. What is the interpretation of this coefficient? To get further insights into the relation between MEDSCHYR and SALES, produce an added variable plot controlling for the effects of MEDHVL and POP. Check that the correlation associated with this plot agrees with your answer in part (g). Re-run the regression in part (f), after removing observation 11. Cite the basic summary statistics from this regression. For this model fit, is MEDSCHYR a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Re-run the regression in part (f), after removing observation 9. Cite the basic summary statistics from this regression. 3.5. Insurance Company Expenses. This exercise considers insurance company data from the NAIC and described in Exercise 1. Table 3.10 describes several variables that can be used to explain expenses. As with Segal’s (2002) study of life insurers, firm “outputs” consist of premiums written (for property and casualty, these are subdivided into personal and commercial lines) as well as losses (subdivided into short and long tail lines). ASSETS and CASH are commonly used measures of the size of a company. GROUP, STOCK, and MUTUAL describe the organizational structure. Firm “inputs” were gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, from the Occupational Employee Statistics program). WAGESTAFF is calculated as the average wage in the state where the insurance company is headquartered. AGENTWAGE is calculated as the weighted average of annual wages of the brokerage industry, weighted by the percentage of gross premium written in each state. Table 3.10: Insurer Expense Variables Variable Description EXPENSES Total expenses incurred, in millions of dollars LOSSLONG Losses incurred for long tail lines, in millions of dollars LOSSSHORT Losses incurred for short tail lines, in millions of dollars GPWPERSONAL Gross premium written for personal lines, in millions of dollars GPWCOMM Gross premium written for commercial lines, in millions of dollars ASSETS Net admitted assets, in millions of dollars CASH Cash and invested assets, in millions of dollars GROUP Indicates if the company is affiliated STOCK Indicates if the company is a stock company MUTUAL Indicates if the company is a mutual company STAFFWAGE Annual average wage of the insurer’s administrative staff, in thousands of dollars AGENTWAGE Annual average wage of the insurance agent, in thousands of dollars A preliminary inspection of the data showed that many firms did not report any insurance losses incurred in 2005. For this exercise, we consider the 384 companies with some losses in the file NAICExpense.csv. Summary Statistics Produce summary statistics of the response variable and the (non-binary) explanatory variables. Note the pattern of skewness for each variable. Note that many variables have negative values. Transform Variables Transform each non-binary variable through the modified logarithm transform, \\(\\ln(1+x)\\). Produce summary statistics of these modified non-binary explanatory variables. Let LNEXPENSES (\\(= \\ln(1+\\text{EXPENSES})\\)) denote the modified expense variable. For subsequent analysis, use only the modified variables described in part (b). Correlation Table Produce a table of correlations for the non-binary variables. What three variables are most highly correlated with LNEXPENSES? Boxplot of LNEXPENSES by GROUP Provide a boxplot of LNEXPENSES by level of GROUP. Which level of group has higher expenses? Linear Model on All Variables Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on all eleven explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), and its adjusted version, \\(R^2_a\\). Reduced Model Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on a reduced model using eight explanatory variables, dropping CASH, STOCK, and MUTUAL. For the explanatory variables, include ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses, and gross premiums, as well as the two BLS variables. f(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). f(ii). Interpret the coefficient associated with commercial lines gross premiums on the logarithmic scale. f(iii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase? Use your answer in part f(ii) and median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES for this question. Quadratic Terms Square each of the two loss and the two gross premium variables. Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on a reduced model using twelve explanatory variables, the eight variables in part (f) and the four additional squared terms just created. g(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). g(ii). Do the quadratic variables appear to be useful explanatory variables? Excluding BLS Variables Now omit the two BLS variables, so you are fitting a model of LNEXPENSES on ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses, and gross premiums, as well as quadratic terms. Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). Comment on the number of observations used to fit this model compared to part (f). Interaction Terms Drop the quadratic terms in part (g) and add interaction terms with the dummy variable GROUP. Thus, there are now eleven variables: ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses and gross premiums, as well as interactions of GROUP with ASSETS and both versions of losses and gross premiums. i(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). i(ii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase for GROUP=0 companies? Use the median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES of GROUP=0 companies for this question. i(iii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase for GROUP=1 companies? Use the median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES of GROUP=1 companies for this question. 3.6 National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercises 1 and 2. Now fit a regression model on LIFEEXP using three explanatory variables: FERTILITY, PUBLICEDUCATION, and lnHEALTH (the natural logarithmic transform of PRIVATEHEALTH). Interpretation of Public Education Coefficient Interpret the regression coefficient associated with PUBLICEDUCATION. Interpretation of Health Expenditures Coefficient Interpret the regression coefficient associated with HEALTH expenditures without using the logarithmic scale for expenditures. Statistical Significance of PUBLICEDUCATION Based on the model fit, is PUBLICEDUCATION a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rule. Added Variable Plot The negative sign of the PUBLICEDUCATION coefficient is surprising, given that the sign of the correlation between PUBLICEDUCATION and LIFEEXP is positive and intuition suggests a positive relation. To check this result, an added variable plot appears in Figure 3.11. d(i). For an added variable plot, describe its purpose and a method for producing it. d(ii). Calculate the correlation corresponding to the added variable plot that appears in Figure 3.11.
