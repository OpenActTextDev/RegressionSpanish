**What?** The purpose of this project is to develop a Spanish translation for the text *Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Application.* This translation will be open and freely available - a resource for our community. 

**Why?** Regression provides the foundations for data science techniques such as machine learning. Although this book is a bit dated (written in 2009), it provides an easy introduction to statistical learning tools geared for applications of interest to actuaries and other financial analysts.

**Who?** 

* Jed Frees <jfrees@bus.wisc.edu> is the author of the text and has secured permission from Cambridge University Press to publish an online Spanish version. Jed is learning Spanish and is familiar with online publishing. He will take responsibility for uploading the translated version to the web.
* Armando Zarruk Rivera <azarrukr@unal.edu.co> is the chair of the Society of Actuaries Latin America Committee. He is coordinating translation volunteers.


**How?** We are following a procedure similar to our successful Spanish version of *Loss Data Analytics*, available at https://openacttexts.github.io/LDASpanish/.
Check out our [Google Usage Data](https://openacttextdev.github.io/LDA_Ed2/GoogleAnalyticsUsage2023.html) to see who is using this book.

In short, Jed is converting his text, written in 2009 using latex, to R markdown, and then using ChatGPT for the initial translation into Spanish.
Translation volunteers will review this translation.

Translation volunteers will supply Jed with the corrections and he will correct the online version. 

*  If the number of suggested changes are small, probably these easiest thing is to send them directly to Jed. (For example, give an approximate location, indicate the old and revised versions.)
*  If major changes are required, please go to the [Github](https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/RegressionSpanish) page, download the .Rmd file, make the changes in the file, and send on to Jed.

An ".Rmd" file is based on R's version of a markdown file. You can open it with any text editor (e.g. Notepad - not Word), make changes, and save as text file.
