[["preface.html", "Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Applications Preface Dedication Forward", " Regression Modeling with Actuarial and Financial Applications Edward (Jed) Frees, University of Wisconsin - Madison, Australian National University Preface Dedication There is an old saying, attributed to Sir Issac Newton and that can be found on web at Google Scholar, If I have seen far, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants. I dedicate this book to the memory of two giants who helped me, and everyone who knew them, see farther and live better lives: James C. Hickman and Joseph P. Sullivan. Forward Actuaries and other financial analysts quantify situations using data – we are ‘numbers’ people. Many of our approaches and models are stylized, based on years of experience and investigations performed by legions of analysts. However, the financial and risk management world evolves rapidly. Many analysts are confronted with new situations in which tried-and-true methods simply do not work. This is where a toolkit like regression analysis comes in. Regression is the study of relationships among variables. It is a generic statistics discipline that is not restricted to the financial world – it has applications in fields of social, biological and physical sciences. You can use regression techniques to investigate large and complex data sets. To familiarize you with regression, this book explores many examples and data sets based on actuarial and financial applications. This is not to say that you will not encounter applications outside of the financial world (for example, an actuary may need to understand the latest scientific evidence on genetic testing for underwriting purposes). However, as you become acquainted with this toolkit, you will see how regression can be applied in many (and sometimes new) situations. Who Is This Book For? This book is written for financial analysts who face uncertain events and wish to quantify these events using empirical information. No industry knowledge is assumed although readers will find the reading much easier if they have an interest in the applications discussed here! This book is designed for students who are just being introduced to the field as well as industry analysts who would like to brush up on old techniques and (for the later chapters) get an introduction to new developments. To read this book, I assume knowledge comparable to a one semester introduction to probability and statistics - Appendix A1 provides a brief review to brush up if you are rusty. Actuarial students in North America will have a one-year introduction to probability and statistics - this type of introduction will help readers grasp concepts more quickly than a one semester background. Finally, readers will find matrix, or linear, algebra helpful, although not a prerequisite for reading this text. Different readers are interested in understanding statistics at different levels. This book is written to accommodate the ‘armchair reader,’ that is, one who passively reads and does not get involved by attempting the exercises in the text. Consider an analogy to football, or any other game. Just like the armchair quarterback of football, there is a great deal that you can learn about the game just by watching. However, if you want to sharpen your skills, you have to go out and play the game. If you do the exercises or reproduce the statistical analyses in the text, you will become a better player. Still, this text is written by interweaving examples with the basic principles. Thus, even the armchair reader can obtain a solid understanding of regression techniques through this text. What Is This Book About? The Table of Contents provides an overview of the topics covered, organized into four parts. The first part introduces linear regression. This is the core material of the book, with refreshers on mathematical statistics, distributions and matrix algebra woven in as needed. The second part is devoted to topics in times series. Why integrate time series topics into a regression book? The reasons are simple, yet compelling; most accounting, financial and economic data become available over time. Although cross-sectional inferences are useful, business decisions need to be made in real time with currently available data. Chapters 7-10 introduce time series techniques that can be readily accomplished using regression tools (and there are many). Nonlinear regression is the subject of the third part. Many modern day ‘predictive modeling’ tools are based on nonlinear regression - these are the workhorses of statistical shops in the financial and risk management industry. The fourth part concerns ‘actuarial applications,’ topics that I have found relevant in my research and consulting work in financial risk management. The first four chapters of this part consists of variations of regression models that are particularly useful in risk management. The last two chapters focus on communications, specifically, report writing and designing graphs. Communicating information is an important aspect of every technical discipline and statistics is certainly no exception. How Does This Book Deliver Its Message? Chapter Development. Each chapter has several examples interwoven with theory. In chapters where a model is introduced, I begin with an example and discuss the data analysis without regard to the theory. This analysis is presented at an intuitive level, without reference to a specific model. This is straightforward, because it amounts to little more than curve fitting. The theme is to have students summarize data sensibly without having the notion of a model obscure good data analysis. Then, an introduction to the theory is provided in the context of the introductory example. One or more additional examples follow that reinforce the theory already introduced and provide a context for explaining additional theory. In Chapters 5 and 6, that do not introduce models but rather techniques for analysis, I begin with an introduction of the technique. This introduction is then followed by an example that reinforces the explanation. In this way, the data analysis can be easily omitted without loss of continuity, if time is a concern. Real Data. Many of the exercises ask the reader to work with real data. The need for working with real data is well documented; for example, see Hogg (1972) or Singer and Willett (1990). Some criteria of Singer and Willett for judging a good data set include: (1) authenticity, (2) availability of background information, (3) interest and relevance to substantive learning, and (4) availability of elements with which readers can identify. Of course, there are some important disadvantages to working with real data. Data sets can quickly become outdated. Further, the ideal data set to illustrate a specific statistical issue is difficult to find. This is because with real data, almost by definition, several issues occur simultaneously. This makes it difficult to isolate a specific aspect. I particularly enjoy working with large data sets. The larger the data set, the greater is the need for statistics to summarize the information content. Statistical Software and Data. My goal in writing this text is to reach a broad group of students and industry analysts. Thus, to avoid excluding large segments, I chose not to integrate any specific statistical software package into the text. Nonetheless, because of the applications orientation, it is critical that the methodology presented be easily accomplished using readily available packages. For the course taught at the University of Wisconsin, I use the statistical packages SAS and R. On the book web site, http://research.bus.wisc.edu/RegActuaries users will find scripts written in SAS and R for the analysis presented in the text. The data are available in text format, allowing readers to employ any statistical packages that they wish. When you see a display such as this in the margin, you will also be able to find this data set (TermLife) on the book web site. Code in the Online Version. Most of the illustrative calculations for the book, written about 2008, were done in SAS. In keeping with modern approach to analytics, the illustrative code provided in the online version are in the statistical software R. Thus, users should expect to see some some discrepancies between the results in the book and those that are calculated using the R software. Technical Supplements. The technical supplements reinforce and extend the results in the main body of the text by giving a more formal, mathematical treatment of the material. This treatment is in fact a supplement because the applications and examples are described in the main body of the text. For readers with sufficient mathematical background, the supplements provide additional material that is useful in communicating to technical audiences. The technical supplements provide a deeper, and broader, coverage of applied regression analysis. I believe that analysts should have an idea of ‘what is going on under the hood,’ or ‘how the engine works.’ Most of these topics will be omitted from the first reading of the material. However, as you work with regression, you will be confronted with questions on ‘Why?’ and you will need to get into the details to see exactly how a certain technique works. Further, the technical supplements provide a menu of optional items that an instructor may wish to cover. Suggested Courses. There is a wide variety of topics that can go into a regression course. Here are some suggested courses. The course that I teach at the University of Wisconsin is the first on the list in the following table. \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{ll} \\begin{array}{lll} \\hline \\textbf{Audience} &amp; \\textbf{Nature of Course}&amp; \\textbf{Suggested Chapters} \\\\ \\hline \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Survey of regression and} &amp; \\text{Chapters } 1-8 ,11-13, 20-21,\\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; ~~~\\text{time series models} &amp; ~~~\\text{main body of text only} \\\\ \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Regression and time} &amp; \\text{ Chapters } 1-8, 20-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; ~~~\\text{series models} &amp; ~~~\\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\text{One-year background in} &amp; \\text{Regression modeling} &amp; \\text{Chapters } 1-6, 11-13, 20-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{probability and statistics} &amp; &amp; ~~~ \\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\text{Background in statistics}&amp; \\text{Actuarial regression}&amp; \\text{ Chapters } 10-21, \\text{selected} \\\\ ~~~\\text{and linear regression}&amp; ~~~\\text{models} &amp; ~~~ \\text{portions of technical supplements} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\end{array} } \\] In addition to these suggested courses, this book is designed for supplemental reading for a time series course as well as a reference book for industry analysts. My hope is that college students who use the beginning parts of the book in their university course will find the later chapters helpful in their industry positions. In this way I hope to promote life-long learning! Acknowledgements It is appropriate to begin the acknowledgement section by thanking the students in the actuarial program here at the University of Wisconsin; students are important partners in the knowledge creation and dissemination business at universities. Through their questions and feedback, I have learned a tremendous amount over the years. I have also benefited from excellent assistance from those who have helped me pull together all the pieces for this book, specifically, Missy Pinney, Peng Shi, Yunjie (Winnie) Sun and Ziyan Xie. I have enjoyed working with several former students and colleagues on regression problems over the recent years, including Katrien Antonio, Jie Gao, Paul Johnson, Margie Rosenberg, Jiafeng Sun, Emil Valdez and Ping Wang. Their contributions are reflected indirectly throughout the text. Because of my long association with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, I am reluctant to go back further in time and provide a longer list for fear of missing important individuals. I have also been fortunate to have a more recent association with the Insurance Services Office (ISO). Colleagues at ISO have provided me with important insights into applications. Through this text that features applications of regression into actuarial and financial industry problems, I hope to encourage the fostering of additional partnerships between academia and industry. I am pleased to acknowledge detailed reviews that I have received from colleagues Tim Welnetz and Margie Rosenberg. I also wish to thank Bob Miller for permission to include our joint work on designing effective graphs in Chapter 21. Bob has taught me a lot about regression over the years.

Regression analysis is a statistical method that is widely used in many fields of study, with actuarial science being no exception. This chapter provides an introduction to the role of the normal distribution in regression, the use of logarithmic transformations in specifying regression relationships and the sampling basis that is critical for inferring regression results to broad populations of interest. 1.1 What is Regression Analysis? Statistics is about data. As a discipline, it is about the collection, summarization and analysis of data to make statements about the real world. When analysts collect data, they are really collecting information that is quantified, that is, transformed to a numerical scale. There are easy, well-understood rules for reducing the data, using either numerical or graphical summary measures. These summary measures can then be linked to a theoretical representation, or model, of the data. With a model that is calibrated by data, statements about the world can be made. Statistical methods have had a major impact on several fields of study. In the area of data collection, the careful design of sample surveys is crucial to market research groups and to the auditing procedures of accounting firms. Experimental design is a second subdiscipline devoted to data collection. The focus of experimental design is on constructing methods of data collection that will extract information in the most efficient way possible. This is especially important in fields such as agriculture and engineering where each observation is expensive, possibly costing millions of dollars. Other applied statistical methods focus on managing and predicting data. Process control deals with monitoring a process over time and deciding when intervention is most fruitful. Process control helps manage the quality of goods produced by manufacturers. Forecasting is about extrapolating a process into the future, whether it be sales of a product or movements of an interest rate. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to analyze data. As we will see, the distinguishing feature of this method is the ability to make statements about variables after having controlled for values of known explanatory variables. Important as other methods are, it is regression analysis that has been most influential. To illustrate, an index of business journals, ABI/INFORM, lists over twenty-four thousand articles using regression techniques over the thirty-year period 1978-2007. And these are only the applications that were considered innovative enough to be published in scholarly reviews! Regression analysis of data is so pervasive in modern business that it is easy to overlook the fact that the methodology is barely over 120 years old. Scholars attribute the birth of regression to the 1885 presidential address of Sir Francis Galton to the anthropological section of the British Association of the Advancement of Sciences. In that address, described in Stigler (1986), Galton provided a description of regression and linked it to normal curve theory. His discovery arose from his studies of properties of natural selection and inheritance. To illustrate a data set that can be analyzed using regression methods, Table 1.1 displays some data included in Galton’s 1885 paper. This table displays the heights of 928 adult children, classified by an index of their parents’ height. Here, all female heights were multiplied by 1.08, and the index was created by taking the average of the father’s height and rescaled mother’s height. Galton was aware that the parents’ and the adult child’s height could each be adequately approximated by a normal curve. In developing regression analysis, he provided a single model for the joint distribution of heights.

Thus, we use the term explanatory variable for measurements that provide information about a variable of interest. Regression analysis is a method to quantify the relationship between a variable of interest and explanatory variables. The methodology used to study the data in Table 1.1 can also be used to study actuarial and other risk management problems, the thesis of this book. 1.2 Fitting Data to a Normal Distribution Historically, the normal distribution had a pivotal role in the development of regression analysis. It continues to play an important role, although we will be interested in extending regression ideas to highly ‘non-normal’ data. Formally, the normal curve is defined by the function \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{f}(y)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma ^{2}% }\\left( y-\\mu \\right) ^{2}\\right) . \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] This curve is a probability density function with the whole real line as its domain. From equation (1.1), we see that the curve is symmetric about \\(\\mu\\) (the mean and median). The degree of peakedness is controlled by the parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). These two parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\), are known as the location and scale parameters, respectively. Appendix A3.1 provides additional details about this curve, including a graph and tables of its cumulative distribution that we will use throughout the text. The normal curve is also depicted in Figure 1.1, a display of a now out-of-date German currency note, the ten Deutsche Mark. This note contains the image of German Carl Gauss, an eminent mathematician whose name is often linked with the normal curve (it is sometimes referred to as the Gaussian curve). Gauss developed the normal curve in connection with the theory of least squares for fitting curves to data in 1809, about the same time as related work by the French scientist Pierre LaPlace. According to Stigler (1986), there was quite a bit of acrimony between these two scientists about the priority of discovery! The normal curve was first used as an approximation to histograms of data around 1835 by Adolph Quetelet, a Belgian mathematician and social scientist. Like many good things, the normal curve had been around for some time, since about 1720 when Abraham de Moivre derived it for his work on modeling games of chance. The normal curve is popular because it is easy to use and has proved to be successful in many applications. Figure 1.1: Ten Deutsche Mark. German currency featuring scientist Gauss and the normal curve. Example: Massachusetts Bodily Injury Claims. For our first look at fitting the normal curve to a set of data, we consider data from Rempala and Derrig (2005). They considered claims arising from automobile bodily injury insurance coverages. These are amounts incurred for outpatient medical treatments that arise from automobile accidents, typically sprains, broken collarbones and the like. The data consists of a sample of 272 claims from Massachusetts that were closed in 2001 (by ‘closed,’ we mean that the claim is settled and no additional liabilities can arise from the same accident). Rempala and Derrig were interested in developing procedures for handling mixtures of ‘typical’ claims and others from providers who reported claims fraudulently. For this sample, we consider only those typical claims, ignoring the potentially fraudulent ones. Table 1.2 provides several statistics that summarize different aspects of the distribution. Claim amounts are in units of logarithms of thousands of dollars. The average logarithmic claim is 0.481, corresponding to $1,617.77 (=1000 \\(\\exp(0.481)\\)). The smallest and largest claims are -3.101 (45 dollars) and 3.912 (50,000 dollars), respectively. Table 1.2: Summary Statistics of Massachusetts Automobile Bodily Injury Claims Number Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum 25th Percentile 75th Percentile Claims 272 0.481 0.793 1.101 -3.101 3.912 -0.114 1.168 For completeness, here are a few definitions. The sample is the set of data available for analysis, denoted by \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\). Here, \\(n\\) is the number of observations, \\(y_1\\) represents the first observation, \\(y_2\\) the second, and so on up to \\(y_n\\) for the \\(nth\\) observation. Here are a few important summary statistics. Basic Summary Statistics The mean is the average of observations, that is, the sum of the observations divided by the number of units. Using algebraic notation, the mean is \\[ \\overline{y}=\\frac{1}{n}\\left( y_1 + \\cdots + y_n \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i. \\] The median is the middle observation when the observations are ordered by size. That is, it is the observation at which 50% are below it (and 50% are above it). The standard deviation is a measure of the spread, or scale, of the distribution. It is computed as \\[ s_y = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^{2}} . \\] A percentile is a number at which a specified fraction of the observations is below it, when the observations are ordered by size. For example, the 25th percentile is that number so that 25% of observations are below it. To help visualize the distribution, Figure 1.2 displays a histogram of the data. Here, the height of each rectangle shows the relative frequency of observations that fall within the range given by its base. The histogram provides a quick visual impression of the distribution; it shows that the range of the data is approximately (-4,4), the central tendency is slightly greater than zero and that the distribution is roughly symmetric. Normal Curve Approximation. Figure 1.2 also shows a normal curve superimposed, using \\(\\overline{y}\\) for \\(\\mu\\) and \\(s_y^{2}\\) for \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). With the normal curve, only two quantities (\\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\)) are required to summarize the entire distribution. For example, Table 1.2 shows that 1.168 is the 75th percentile, which is approximately the 204th (\\(=0.75\\times 272\\)) largest observation from the entire sample. From the equation (1.1) normal distribution, we have that \\(z=(y-\\mu )/\\sigma\\) is a standard normal, of which 0.675 is the 75th percentile. Thus, \\(\\overline{y}+0.675s_y=\\) \\(0.481+0.675\\times 1.101=1.224\\) is the 75th percentile using the normal curve approximation.

A quick visual inspection of a variable’s distribution can reveal some surprising features that are hidden by statistics, numerical summary measures. The box plot, also known as a ‘box and whiskers’ plot, is one such graphical device. Figure 1.3 illustrates a box plot for the bodily injury claims. Here, the box captures the middle 50% of the data, with the three horizontal lines corresponding to the 75th, 50th and 25th percentiles, reading from top to bottom. The horizontal lines above and below the box are the ‘whiskers.’ The upper whisker is 1.5 times the interquartile range (the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles) above the 75th percentile. Similarly, the lower whisker is 1.5 times the interquartile range below the 25th percentile. Individual observations outside the whiskers are denoted by small circular plotting symbols, and are referred to as ‘outliers.’ Figure 1.3: Box plot of bodily injury claims.

However, by their very flexibility, graphs can also readily deceive the analyst. Chapter 21 will underscore this point. For example, Figure 1.4 is a re-drawing of Figure 1.2; the difference is that Figure 1.4 uses more, and finer, rectangles. This finer analysis reveals the asymmetric nature of the sample distribution that was not evident in Figure 1.2. Figure 1.4: Redrawing of Figure 1.2 with an increased number of rectangles. R Code to Produce Figure 1.4 hist(LOGCLAIMS, freq=FALSE, nclass=32, main=&quot;&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) mtext(&quot;Density&quot;, side=2, at=.75,las=1, adj=.7,cex=1.1) lines(x,y) Quantile-Quantile Plots. Increasing the number of rectangles can unmask features that were not previously apparent; however, there are in general fewer observations per rectangle meaning that the uncertainty of the relative frequency estimate increases. This represents a trade-off. Instead of forcing the analyst to make an arbitrary decision about the number of rectangles, an alternative is to use a graphical device for comparing a distribution to another known as a quantile-quantile, or qq, plot. Figure 1.5 illustrates a \\(qq\\) plot for the bodily injury data using the normal curve as a reference distribution. For each point, the vertical axis gives the quantile using the sample distribution. The horizontal axis gives the corresponding quantity using the normal curve. For example, earlier we considered the 75th percentile point. This point appears as (1.168, 0.675) on the graph. To interpret a \\(qq\\) plot, if the quantile points lie along the superimposed line, then the sample and the normal reference distribution have the same shape. (This line is defined by connecting the 75th and 25th percentiles.) In Figure 1.5, the small sample percentiles are consistently smaller than the corresponding values from the standard normal, indicating that the distribution is skewed to the left. The difference in values at the ends of the distribution are due to the outliers noted earlier that could also be interpreted as the sample distribution having larger tails than the normal reference distribution.

R Code to Produce Figure 1.5 qqnorm(LOGCLAIMS, main=&quot;&quot;, las=1, ylab=&quot;&quot;) mtext(&quot;Sample Quantiles&quot;, side=2, at=4.5, las=1,cex=1.1,adj=.4) qqline(LOGCLAIMS) 1.3 Power Transforms In the Section 1.2 example, we considered claims without justifying the use of the logarithmic scaling. When analyzing variables such as assets of firms, wages of individuals and housing prices of households in business and economic applications, it is common to consider logarithmic instead of the original units. A log transform retains the original ordering (for example, large wages remain large on the log wage scale) but serves to ‘pull in’ extreme values of the distribution. To illustrate, Figure 1.6 shows the bodily injury claims distribution in (thousands of) dollars. In order to graph the data meaningfully, the largest observation ($50,000) was removed prior to making this plot. Even with this observation removed, Figure 1.6 shows that the distribution is heavily lop-sided to the right, with several large values of claims appearing. Distributions that are lopsided in one direction or the other are known as skewed. Figure 1.6 is an example of a distribution skewed to the right, or positively skewed. Here, the tail of the distribution on the right is longer and there is a greater concentration of mass to the left. In contrast, a left-skewed, or negatively skewed distribution, has a longer tail on the left and a greater concentration of mass to the right. Many insurance claims distributions are right-skewed (see the text by Klugman, Panjer and Willmot, 2008, for extensive discussions). As we saw in Figures 1.4 and 1.5, a logarithmic transformation yields a distribution that is only mildly skewed to the left. Figure 1.6: Distribution of Bodily Injury Claims. Observations are in (thousands of) dollars with the largest observation omitted.. R Code to Produce Figure 1.6 injury3 = subset(injury, claims &lt; 25 ) CLAIMS25 &lt;- injury3$claims par(mar=c(4.2,4,1.2,.2),cex=1.1) hist(CLAIMS25, freq=FALSE, main=&quot;&quot;, las=1, ylab=&quot;&quot;, xlab=&quot;CLAIMS&quot;) mtext(&quot;Density&quot;, side=2, at=.28, las=1,cex=1.1) Logarithmic transformations are used extensively in applied statistics work. One advantage is that they serve to symmetrize distributions that are skewed. More generally, we consider power transforms, also known as the Box-Cox family of transforms. Within this family of transforms, in lieu of using the response \\(y\\), we use a transformed, or rescaled version, \\(y^{\\lambda}\\). Here, the power \\(\\lambda\\) (lambda, a Greek ‘el’) is a number that may be user specified. Typical values of \\(\\lambda\\) that are used in practice are \\(\\lambda\\)=1, 1/2, 0 or -1. When we use \\(\\lambda =0\\), we mean \\(\\ln (y)\\), that is, the natural logarithmic transform. More formally, the Box-Cox family can be expressed as \\[ y^{(\\lambda )}=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{y^{\\lambda }-1}{\\lambda } &amp; \\lambda \\neq 0 \\\\ \\ln (y) &amp; \\lambda =0 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] As we will see, because regression estimates are not affected by location and scale shifts, in practice we do not need to subtract one nor divide by \\(\\lambda\\) when rescaling the response. The advantage of the above expression is that, if we let \\(\\lambda\\) approach 0, then \\(y^{(\\lambda )}\\) approaches \\(\\ln (y)\\), from some straightforward calculus arguments. To illustrate the usefulness of transformations, we simulated 500 observations from a chi-square distribution with two degrees of freedom. Appendix A3.2 introduces this distribution (that we will encounter again later in studying the behavior of test statistics). The upper left panel of Figure 1.7 shows the original distribution is heavily skewed to the right. The other panels in Figure 1.7 show the data rescaled using the square root, logarithmic and negative reciprocal transformations. The logarithmic transformation, in the lower left panel, provides the best approximation to symmetry for this example. The negative reciprocal transformation is based on \\(\\lambda =-1\\), and then multiplying the rescaled observations by minus one, so that large observations remain large. Figure 1.7: 500 simulated observations from a chi-square distribution. The upper left panel is based on the original distribution. The upper right corresponds to the square root transform, the lower left to the log transform and the lower right to the negative reciprocal transform.

Collections of statistics are very useful for analysts, decision-makers and everyday consumers for understanding massive amounts of data that represent complex situations. To this point, our focus has been on introducing sensible techniques to summarize variables; techniques that will be used repeatedly thoughout this text. However, the true usefulness of the discipline of statistics is its ability to say something about the unknown, not merely to summarize information already available. To this end, we need to make some fairly formal assumptions about the manner in which the data are observed. As a science, a strong feature of statistics (as a discipline) is the ability to critique these assumptions and offer improved alternatives in specific situations. It is customary to assume that the data are drawn from a larger population that we are interested in describing. The process of drawing the data is known as the sampling, or data generating, process. We denote this sample as \\(\\{y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\}\\). So that we may critique, and modify, these sampling assumptions, we list them below in detail: \\[ \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\textbf{Basic Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline 1. ~\\mathrm{E~}y_i=\\mu \\\\ 2. ~\\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\sigma ^{2} \\\\ 3. ~\\{y_i\\} \\text{ are independent} \\\\ 4. ~\\{y_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed}. \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] In this basic set-up, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) serve as parameters that describe the location and scale of the parent population. The goal is to infer something sensible about them based on statistics such as \\(\\overline{y}\\) and \\(s_y^{2}\\). For the third assumption, we assume independence among the draws. In a sampling scheme, this may be guaranteed by taking a simple random sample from a population. The fourth assumption is not required for many statistical inference procedures because central limit theorems provide approximate normality for many statistics of interest. However, a formal justification of some statistics, such as \\(t\\)-statistics, requires this additional assumption. Section 1.8 provides an explicit statement of one version of the central limit theorem, giving conditions under which \\(\\overline{y}\\) is approximately normally distributed. This section also discusses a related result, known as an Edgeworth approximation, that shows that the quality of the normal approximation is better for symmetric parent populations when compared to skewed distributions. How does this discussion apply to the study of regression analysis? After all, so far we have focused only on the simple arithmetic average, \\(\\overline{y}\\). In subsequent chapters, we will emphasize that linear regression is the study of weighted averages; specifically, many regression coefficients can be expressed as weighted averages with appropriately chosen weights. Central limit and Edgeworth approximation theorems are available for weighted averages - these results will ensure approximate normality of regression coefficients. To use normal curve approximations in a regression context, we will often transform variables to achieve approximate symmetry. 1.5 Regression and Sampling Designs Approximating normality will be an important issue in practical applications of linear regression. Parts I and II of this book focus on linear regression, where we will learn basic regression concepts and sampling design. Part III will focus on nonlinear regression, involving binary, count and fat-tailed responses, where the normal is not the most helpful reference distribution. Ideas concerning basic concepts and design will also be used in the nonlinear setting. In regression analysis, we focus on one measurement of interest and call this the dependent variable. Other measurements are used as explanatory variables. A goal is to compare differences in the dependent variable in terms of differences in the explanatory variables. As noted in Section 1.1, regression is used extensively in many scientific fields. Table 1.3 lists alternative terms that you may encounter as you read regression applications. Table 1.3. Terminology for Regression Variables \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline\\hline y-\\text{Variable} &amp; x-\\text{Variable} \\\\\\hline \\text{Outcome of interest} &amp; \\text{Explanatory variable} \\\\ \\text{Dependent variable} &amp; \\text{Independent variable} \\\\ \\text{Endogenous variable} &amp; \\text{Exogenous variable} \\\\ \\text{Response} &amp; \\text{Treatment} \\\\ \\text{Regressand} &amp; \\text{Regressor} \\\\ \\text{Left-hand side variable} &amp; \\text{Right-hand side variable} \\\\ \\text{Explained variable } &amp; \\text{Predictor variable} \\\\ \\text{Output} &amp; \\text{Input} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] In the latter part of the nineteenth century and early part of the twentieth century, statistics was beginning to make an important impact on the development of experimental science. Experimental sciences often use designed studies, where the data are under the control of an analyst. Designed studies are performed in laboratory settings, where there are tight physical restrictions on every variable that a researcher thinks may be important. Designed studies also occur in larger field experiments, where the mechanisms for control are different than in laboratory settings. Agriculture and medicine use designed studies. Data from a designed study are said to be experimental data. To illustrate, a classic example is to consider the yield of a crop such as corn, where each of several parcels of land (the observations) are assigned various levels of fertilizer. The goal is to ascertain the effect of fertilizer (the explanatory variable) on the corn yield (the response variable). Although researchers attempt to make parcels of land as much alike as possible, differences inevitably arise. Agricultural researchers use randomization techniques to assign different levels of fertilizer to each parcel of land. In this way, analysts can explain the variation in corn yields in terms of the variation of fertilizer levels. Through the use of randomization techniques, researchers using designed studies can infer that the treatment has a causal effect on the response. Chapter 6 discusses causality further. Example: Rand Health Insurance Experiment. How are medical care expenditures related to the demand for insurance? Many studies have established a positive relation between the amount spent on medical care and the demand for health insurance. Those in poor health anticipate using more medical services than similarly positioned people in good or fair health and will seek higher levels of health insurance to compensate for these anticipated expenditures. They obtain this additional health insurance by (i) selecting a more generous health insurance plan from an employer, (ii) choosing an employer with a more generous health insurance plan or (iii) paying more for individual health insurance. Thus, it is difficult to disentangle the cause and effect relationship of medical care expenditures and the availability of health insurance. A study reported by Manning et al. (1987) sought to answer this question using a carefully designed experiment. In this study, enrolled households from six cities, between November 1974 and February 1977, were randomly assigned to one of 14 different insurance plans. These plans varied by the cost-sharing elements, the co-insurance rate (the percentage paid on out-of-pocket expenditures which varied by 0, 25, 50 and 95%) as well as the deductible (5, 10 or 15 percent of family income, up to a maximum of $1,000). Thus, there was a random assignment to levels of the treatment, the amount of health insurance. The study found that more favorable plans resulted in greater total expenditures, even after controlling for participants’ health status. For actuarial science and other social sciences, designed studies are the exception rather than the rule. For example, if we want to study the effects of smoking on mortality, it is highly unlikely that we could get study participants to agree to be randomly assigned to smoker/nonsmoker groups for several years just so that we could observe their mortality patterns! As with the Section 1.1 Galton study, social science researchers generally work with observational data. Observational data are not under control of the analyst. With observational data, we can not infer causal relationships but we can readily introduce measures of association. To illustrate, in the Galton data, it is apparent that ‘tall’ parents are likely to have ‘tall’ children and conversely ‘short’ parents are likely to have ‘short’ children. Chapter 2 will introduce a correlation and other measures of association. However, we can not infer causality from the data. For example, there may be another variable, such as family diet, that is related to both variables. Good diet in the family could be associated with tall heights of parents and adult children, whereas poor diet stifles growth. If this were the case, we would call family diet a confounding variable. In designed experiments such as the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, we can control for the effects of variables such as health status through random assignment methods. In observational studies, we use statistical control, rather than experimental control. To illustrate, for the Galton data, we might split our observations into two groups, one for ‘good family diet’ and one for ‘poor family diet,’ and examine the relationship between parents’ and children’s height for each subgroup. This is the essence of the regression method, to compare a \\(y\\) and an \\(x\\), ‘controlling for’ the effects of other explanatory variables. Of course, to use statistical control and regression methods, one must record family diet, and any other measures of height that may confound the effects of parents’ height on the height of their adult child. The difficulty in designing studies is trying to imagine all of the variables that could possibly affect a response variable, an impossible task in most social science problems of interest. To give some guidance on when ‘enough is enough,’ Chapter 6 will discuss measures of an explanatory variable’s importance and its impact on model selection. 1.6 Actuarial Applications of Regression This book introduces a statistical method, regression analysis. The introduction is organized around the traditional triad of statistical inference: hypothesis testing, estimation and prediction. Further, this book shows how this methodology can be used in applications that are likely to be of interest to actuaries and to other risk analysts. As such, it is helpful to begin with the three traditional areas of actuarial applications: pricing, reserving and solvency testing. Pricing and adverse selection. Regression analysis can be used to determine insurance prices for many lines of business. For example, in private passenger automobile insurance, expected claims vary by the insured’s gender, age, location (city versus rural), vehicle purpose (work or pleasure) and a host of other explanatory variables. Regression can be used to identify the variables that are important determinants of expected claims. In competitive markets, insurance companies do not use the same price for all insureds. If they did, ‘good risks,’ those with lower than average expected claims, would overpay and leave the company. In contrast, ‘bad risks,’ those with higher than average expected claims, would remain with the company. If the company continued this flat rate pricing policy, premiums would rise (to compensate for claims by the increasing share of bad risks) and market share would dwindle as the company loses good risks. This problem is known as ‘adverse selection.’ Using an appropriate set of explanatory variables, classification systems can be developed so that each insured pays their fair share. Reserving and solvency testing. Both reserving and solvency testing are concerned with predicting whether liabilities associated with a group of policies will exceed the capital devoted to meeting obligations arising from the policies. Reserving involves determining the appropriate amount of capital to meet these obligations. Solvency testing is about assessing the adequacy of capital to fund the obligations for a block of business. In some practice areas, regression can be used to forecast future obligations to help determine reserves (see, for example, Chapter 19). Regression can also be used to compare characteristics of healthy and financially distressed firms for solvency testing (see, for example, Chapter 14). Other risk management applications. Regression analysis is a quantitative tool that can be applied in a broad variety of business problems, not just the traditional areas of pricing, reserving and solvency testing. By becoming familiar with regression analysis, actuaries will have another quantitative skill that can be brought to bear on general problems involving the financial security of people, companies and governmental organizations. To help you develop insights, this book provides many examples of potential ‘non-actuarial’ applications through featured vignettes labeled as ‘examples’ and illustrative data sets. To help understand potential regression applications, start by reviewing the several data sets featured in the Chapter 1 Exercises. Even if you do not complete the exercises to strengthen your data summary skills (that require the use of a computer), a review of the problem descriptions will help you become more familiar with types of applications in which an actuary might use regression techniques. 1.7 Further Reading and References This book introduces regression and time series tools that are most relevant to actuaries and other financial risk analysts. Fortunately, there are other sources that provide excellent introductions to these statistical topics (although not from a risk management viewpoint). Particularly for analysts that intend to specialize in statistics, it is helpful to get another perspective. For regression, I recommend Weisburg (2005) and Faraway (2005). For time series, Diebold (2004) is a good source. Moreover, Klugman, Panjer and Willmot (2008) provides a good introduction to actuarial applications of statistics; this book is intended to complement the Klugman et al. book by focusing on regression and time series methods.

This exercise considers data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), conducted by the U.S. Agency of Health Research and Quality. MEPS is a probability survey that provides nationally representative estimates of health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian population. This survey collects detailed information on individuals of each medical care episode by type of services including physician office visits, hospital emergency room visits, hospital outpatient visits, hospital inpatient stays, all other medical provider visits, and use of prescribed medicines. This detailed information allows one to develop models of health care utilization to predict future expenditures. You can learn more about MEPS at http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/. We consider MEPS data from the panels 7 and 8 of 2003 that consists of 18,735 individuals between ages 18 and 65. From this sample, we took a random sample of 2,000 individuals that appear in the file ‘HealthExpend’. From this sample, there are 157 individuals that had positive inpatient expenditures. There are also 1,352 that had positive outpatient expenditures. We will analyze these two samples separately. Our dependent variables consist of amounts of expenditures for inpatient (EXPENDIP) and outpatient (EXPENDOP) visits. For MEPS, outpatient events include hospital outpatient department visits, office-based provider visits and emergency room visits excluding dental services. (Dental services, compared to other types of health care services, are more predictable and occur in a more regular basis.) Hospital stays with the same date of admission and discharge, known as ‘zero-night stays,’ were included in outpatient counts and expenditures. (Payments associated with emergency room visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay were included in the inpatient expenditures. Prescribed medicines that can be linked to hospital admissions were included in inpatient expenditures, not in outpatient utilization.) Part 1: Use only the 157 individuals that had positive inpatient expenditures and do the following analysis. Compute descriptive statistics for inpatient (EXPENDIP) expenditures. a(i). What is the typical (mean and median) expenditure? a(ii). How does the standard deviation compare to the mean? Do the data appear to be skewed? Compute a box plot, histogram and a (normal) \\(qq\\) plot for EXPENDIP. Comment on the shape of the distribution. Transformations. c(i). Take a square root transform of inpatient expenditures. Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? c(ii). Take a (natural) logarithmic transformation of inpatient expenditures. Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Part 2: Use only the 1,352 individuals that had positive outpatient expenditures. Repeat part (a) and compute histograms for expenditures and logarithmic expenditures. Comment on the approximate normality for each histogram. 1.2 Nursing Home Utilization. This exercise considers nursing home data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS). The State of Wisconsin Medicaid program funds nursing home care for individuals qualifying on the basis of need and financial status. As part of the conditions for participation, Medicaid-certified nursing homes must file an annual cost report to DHFS, summarizing the volume and cost of care provided to all of its residents, Medicaid-funded and otherwise. These cost reports are audited by DHFS staff and form the basis for facility-specific Medicaid daily payment rates for subsequent periods. The data are publicly available; see [http://dhs.wisconsin.gov] for more information. The DHFS is interested in predictive techniques that provide reliable utilization forecasts to update their Medicaid funding rate schedule of nursing facilities. In this assignment, we consider the data in the file ‘WiscNursingHome’ in cost report years 2000 and 2001. There are 362 facilities in 2000 and 355 facilities in 2001. Typically, utilization of nursing home care is measured in patient days (‘patient days’ is the number of days each patient was in the facility, summed over all patients). For this exercise, we define the outcome variable to be total patient years (TPY), the number of total patient days in the cost reporting period divided by number of facility operating days in the cost reporting period (see Rosenberg et al., 2007, Appendix 1, for further discussion of this choice). The number of beds (NUMBED) and square footage (SQRFOOT) of the nursing home both measure the size of the facility. Not surprisingly, these variables will be important predictors of TPY. Part 1: Use cost report year 2000 data, and do the following analysis. Compute descriptive statistics for TPY, NUMBED, and SQRFOOT. Summarize the distribution of TPY using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Transformations. Take a (natural) logarithmic transformation of TPY (LOGTPY). Summarize the resulting distribution using a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot. Does it appear to be approximately normally distributed? Part 2: Use cost report year 2001 data and repeat parts (a) and (c). 1.3 Automobile Insurance Claims. As an actuarial analyst, you are working with a large insurance company to help them understand their claims distribution for their private passenger automobile policies. You have available claims data for a recent year, consisting of: STATE CODE: codes 01 through 17 used, with each code randomly assigned to an actual individual state CLASS: rating class of operator, based on age, gender, marital status and use of vehicle GENDER: operator gender AGE: operator age PAID: amount paid to settle and close a claim. You are focusing on older drivers, 50 and higher, for which there are \\(n = 6,773\\) claims available. Examine the histogram of the amount PAID and comment on the symmetry. Create a new variable, the (natural) logarithmic claims paid, LNPAID. Create a histogram and a \\(qq\\) plot of LNPAID. Comment on the symmetry of this variable. 1.4 Hospital Costs. Suppose that you are an employee benefits actuary working with a medium size company in Wisconsin. This company is considering offering, for the first time in their industry, hospital insurance coverage to dependent children of their employees. You have access to company records and so have available the number, age and gender of the dependent children but have no other information about hospital costs from the company. In particular, no firm in this industry has offered this coverage and so you have little historical industry experience upon which you can forecast expected claims. You gather data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (NIS-HCUP), a nationwide survey of hospital costs conducted by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). You restrict consideration to Wisconsin hospitals and analyze a random sample of \\(n=500\\) claims from 2003 data. Although the data comes from hospital records, it is organized by individual discharge and so you have information about the age and gender of the patient discharged. Specifically, you consider patients aged 0-17 years. In a separate project, you will consider the frequency of hospitalization. For this project, the goal is to model the severity of hospital charges, by age and gender. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, TOTCHG. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and call the new variable LNTOTCHG. Examine the distribution of this transformed variable. To visualize the logarithmic relationship, plot LNTOTCHG versus TOTCHG. 1.5 Automobile injury insurance claims. We consider automobile injury claims data using data from the Insurance Research Council (IRC), a division of the American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters and the Insurance Institute of America. The data, collected in 2002, contains information on demographic information about the claimant, attorney involvement and the economic loss (LOSS, in thousands), among other variables. We consider here a sample of \\(n=1,340\\) losses from a single state. The full 2002 study contains over 70,000 closed claims based on data from thirty-two insurers. The IRC conducted similar studies in 1977, 1987, 1992 and 1997. Compute descriptive statistics for the total economic loss (LOSS). What is the typical loss? Compute a histogram and (normal) \\(qq\\) plot for LOSS. Comment on the shape of the distribution. Partition the data set into two subsamples, one corresponding to those claims that involved an ATTORNEY (=1) and the other where an ATTORNEY was not involved (=2). c(i). For each subsample, compute the typical loss. Does there appear to be a difference in the typical losses by attorney involvement? c(ii) To compare the distributions, compute a boxplot by level of attorney involvement. c(iii). For each subsample, compute a histogram and \\(qq\\) plot. Compare the two distributions to one another. 1.6 Insurance Company Expenses. Like other businesses, insurance companies seek to minimize expenses associated with doing business in order to enhance profitability. To study expenses, this exercise examines a random sample of 500 insurance companies from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) database of over 3,000 companies. The NAIC maintains one of the world’s largest insurance regulatory databases; we consider here data that are based on 2005 annual reports for all the property and casualty insurance companies in the United States. The annual reports are financial statements that use statutory accounting principles. Specifically, our dependent variable is EXPENSES, the non-claim expenses for a company. Although not needed for this exercise, non-claim expenses are based on three components: unallocated loss adjustment, underwriting and investment expenses. The unallocated loss adjustment expense is the expense not directly attributable to a claim but is indirectly associated with settling claims; it includes items such as the salaries of claims adjusters, legal fees, court costs, expert witnesses and investigation costs. Underwriting expenses consists of policy acquisition costs, such as commissions, as well as the portion of administrative, general and other expenses attributable to underwriting operations. Investment expense are those expenses related to investment activities of the insurer. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, EXPENSES. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and examine the distribution of this transformed variable. Has the transformation helped to symmetrize the distribution? 1.7 National Life Expectancies. Who is doing health care right? Health care decisions are made at the individual, corporate and government levels. Virtually every person, corporation and government have their own perspective on health care; these different perspectives result in a wide variety of systems for managing health care. Comparing different health care systems help us learn about approaches other than our own, which in turn help us make better decisions in designing improved systems. Here, we consider health care systems from \\(n=185\\) countries throughout the world. As a measure of the quality of care, we use LIFEEXP, the life expectancy at birth. This dependent variable, with several explanatory variables, are listed in Table 1.4. From this table, you will note that although there are 185 countries considered in this study, not all countries provided information for each variable. Data not available are noted under the column Num Miss. The data are from the United Nations (UN) Human Development Report. Examine the distribution of the dependent variable, LIFEEXP. Do this by making a histogram and then a \\(qq\\) plot, comparing the empirical to a normal distribution. Take a natural log transformation and examine the distribution of this transformed variable. Has the transformation helped to symmetrize the distribution? Table 1.4.

Thus, it is helpful to provide an explicit statement of one version of the central limit theorem. Central Limit Theorem. Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are independently distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\), finite variance \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}|y|^{3}\\) is finite. Then, \\[ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }\\Pr \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma }(\\overline{y} -\\mu )\\leq x\\right) =\\Phi \\left( x\\right) , \\] for each \\(x,\\) where \\(\\Phi \\left( .\\right)\\) is the standard normal distribution function. Under the assumptions of this theorem, the re-scaled distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) approaches a standard normal as the sample size, \\(n\\), increases. We interpret this as meaning that, for ‘large’ sample sizes, the distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) may be approximated by a normal distribution. Empirical investigations have shown that sample sizes of \\(n=25\\) through 50 provide adequate approximations for most purposes. When does the central limit theorem not work well? Some insights are provided by another result from mathematical statistics. Edgeworth Approximation. Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots, y_n\\) are identically and independently distributed with mean \\(\\mu\\), finite variance \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}|y|^{3}\\) is finite. Then,% \\[ \\Pr \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma }(\\overline{y}-\\mu )\\leq x\\right) =\\Phi \\left( x\\right) +\\frac{1}{6}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi }}e^{-x^{2}/2}\\frac{\\mathrm{E }(y-\\mu )^{3}}{\\sigma ^{3}\\sqrt{n}}+\\frac{h_n}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\] for each \\(x,\\) where \\(h_n\\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty .\\) This result suggests that the distribution of \\(\\bar{y}\\) becomes closer to a normal distribution as the skewness, \\(\\mathrm{E}(\\overline{y} -\\mu )^{3}\\), becomes closer to zero. This is important in insurance applications because many distributions tend to be skewed. Historically, analysts used the second term on the right-hand side of the result to provide a ‘correction’ for the normal curve approximation. See, for example, Beard, Pentik\"{a}inen and Pesonen (1984) for further discussion of Edgeworth approximations in actuarial science. An alternative (used in this book) that we saw in Section 1.3 is to transform the data, thus achieving approximate symmetry. As suggested by the Edgeworth approximation theorem, if our parent population is close to symmetric, then the distribution of \\(\\overline{y}\\) will be approximately normal.

This chapter considers regression in the case of only one explanatory variable. Despite this seeming simplicity, most of the deep ideas of regression can be developed in this framework. By limiting ourselves to the one variable case, we are able to express many calculations using simple algebra. This will allow us to develop our intuition about regression techniques by reinforcing it with simple demonstrations. Further, we can illustrate the relationships between two variables graphically because we are working in only two dimensions. Graphical tools prove to be important for developing a link between the data and a model. 2.1 Correlations and Least Squares Regression is about relationships. Specifically, we will study how two variables, an \\(x\\) and a \\(y\\), are related. We want to be able to answer questions such as, if we change the level of \\(x\\), what will happen to the level of \\(y\\)? If we compare two “subjects” that appear similar except for the \\(x\\) measurement, how will their \\(y\\) measurements differ? Understanding relationships among variables is critical for quantitative management, particularly in actuarial science where uncertainty is so prevalent. It is helpful to work with a specific example to become familiar with key concepts. Analysis of lottery sales has not been part of traditional actuarial practice but it is a growth area in which actuaries could contribute. Example: Wisconsin Lottery Sales. State of Wisconsin lottery administrators are interested in assessing factors that affect lottery sales. Sales consists of online lottery tickets that are sold by selected retail establishments in Wisconsin. These tickets are generally priced at $1.00, so the number of tickets sold equals the lottery revenue. We analyze average lottery sales (SALES) over a forty-week period, April, 1998 through January, 1999, from fifty randomly selected areas identified by postal (ZIP) code within the state of Wisconsin. Although many economic and demographic variables might influence sales, our first analysis focuses on population (POP) as a key determinant. Chapter 3 will show how to consider additional explanatory variables. Intuitively, it seems clear that geographic areas with more people will have higher sales. So, other things being equal, a larger \\(x=POP\\) means a larger \\(y=SALES.\\) However, the lottery is an important source of revenue for the state and we want to be as precise as possible. A little additional notation will be useful subsequently. In this sample, there are fifty geographic areas and we use subscripts to identify each area. For example, \\(y_1\\) = 1,285.4 represents sales for the first area in the sample that has population \\(x_1\\) = 435. Call the ordered pair (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)) = (435, 1285.4) the first observation. Extending this notation, the entire sample containing fifty observations may be represented by (\\(x_1\\), \\(y_1\\)), …, (\\(x_{50}\\), \\(y_{50}\\)). The ellipses ( … ) mean that the pattern is continued until the final object is encountered. We will often speak of a generic member of the sample, referring to (\\(x_i\\), \\(y_i\\)) as the \\(i\\)th observation. Data sets can get complicated, so it will help if you begin by working with each variable separately. The two panels in Figure 2.1 show histograms that give a quick visual impression of the distribution of each variable in isolation of the other. Table 2.1 provides corresponding numerical summaries. To illustrate, for the population variable (POP), we see that the area with the smallest number contained 280 people whereas the largest contained 39,098. The average, over 50 ZIP codes, was 9,311.04. For our second variable, sales were as low as 189 and as high as 33,181. Figure 2.1: Histograms of Population and Sales. Each distribution is skewed to the right, indicating that there are many small areas compared to a few areas with larger sales and populations.

After we understand the information in each variable in isolation of the other, we can begin exploring the relationship between the two variables. Scatter Plot and Correlation Coefficients - Basic Summary Tools The basic graphical tool used to investigate the relationship between the two variables is a scatter plot such as in Figure 2.2. Although we may lose the exact values of the observations when graphing data, we gain a visual impression of the relationship between population and sales. From Figure 2.2 we see that areas with larger populations tend to purchase more lottery tickets. How strong is this relationship? Can knowledge of the area’s population help us anticipate the revenue from lottery sales? We explore these two questions below. Figure 2.2: A scatter plot of the lottery data. Each of the 50 plotting symbols corresponds to a zip code in the study. This figure suggests that postal areas with larger populations have larger lottery revenues. R Code to Produce Figure 2.2 #Lot &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CSVData/WiscLottery.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) # FIGURE 2.2, WITH CORRELATIONS par(mar=c(4.1,3.8,2,1),cex=1.1) plot(Lot$POP, Lot$SALES, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1, xlab = &quot;POP&quot;) mtext(&quot;SALES&quot;,side=2, at=36000, las=1, cex=1.1) One way to summarize the strength of the relationship between two variables is through a correlation statistic. Definition. The ordinary, or Pearson, correlation coefficient is defined as \\[ r=\\frac{1}{(n-1)s_xs_y}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_{i}-\\overline{x}\\right) \\left( y_{i}-\\overline{y}\\right) . \\] Here, we use the sample standard deviation \\(s_y = \\sqrt{(n-1)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\overline{y}\\right)^{2}}\\) defined in Section 1.2, with similar notation for \\(s_x\\). Although there are other correlation statistics, the correlation coefficient devised by Pearson (1895) has several desirable properties. One important property is that, for any data set, \\(r\\) is bounded by -1 and 1, that is, \\(-1\\leq r\\leq 1\\). (Exercise 2A.9 provides steps for you to check this property.) If \\(r\\) is greater than zero, the variables are said to be (positively) correlated. If \\(r\\) is less than zero, the variables are said to be negatively correlated. The larger the coefficient is in absolute value, the stronger is the relationship. In fact, if \\(r=1\\), then the variables are perfectly correlated. In this case, all of the data lie on a straight line that goes through the lower left and upper right-hand quadrants. If \\(r=-1\\), then all of the data lie on a line that goes through the upper left and lower right-hand quadrants. The coefficient \\(r\\) is a measure of a linear relationship between two variables. The correlation coefficient is said to be location and scale invariant. Thus, each variable’s center of location does not matter in the calculation of \\(r\\). For example, if we add $100 to the sales of each zip code, each \\(y_i\\) will increase by 100. However, \\(\\overline{y}\\), the average purchase price will also increase by 100 so that the deviation \\(y_i - \\overline{y}\\) remains unchanged, or invariant. Further, the scale of each variable does not matter in the calculation of \\(r\\). For example, suppose we divide each population by 1000 so that \\(x_i\\) now represents population in thousands. Thus, \\(\\overline{x}\\) is also divided by 1000 and you should check that \\(s_x\\) is also divided by 1000. Thus, the standardized version of \\(x_i\\), \\(\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) /s_x\\), remains unchanged, or invariant. Many statistical packages compute a standardized version of a variable by subtracting the average and dividing by the standard deviation. Now, let’s use \\(y_{i,std}=\\left( y_i- \\overline{y}\\right) /s_y\\) and \\(x_{i,std}=\\left( x_i-\\overline{x} \\right) /s_x\\) to be the standardized versions of \\(y_i\\) and \\(x_i\\), respectively. With this notation, we can express the correlation coefficient as \\(r=(n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i,std}\\times y_{i,std}.\\) The correlation coefficient is said to be a dimensionless measure. This is because we have taken away dollars, and all other units of measures, by considering the standardized variables \\(x_{i,std}\\) and \\(y_{i,std}\\). Because the correlation coefficient does not depend on units of measure, it is a statistic that can readily be compared across different data sets. In the world of business, the term “correlation” is often used as synonymous with the term “relationship.” For the purposes of this text, we use the term correlation when referring only to linear relationships. The classic nonlinear relationship is \\(y=x^{2}\\), a quadratic relationship. Consider this relationship and the fictitious data set for \\(x\\), \\(\\{-2,1,0,1,2\\}\\). Now, as an exercise (2.2), produce a rough graph of the data set: \\[ \\begin{array}{l|rrrrr} \\hline i &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 \\\\ \\hline x_i &amp; -2 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ y_i &amp; 4 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] The correlation coefficient for this data set turns out to be \\(r=0\\) (check this). Thus, despite the fact that there is a perfect relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) (\\(=x^{2}\\)), there is a zero correlation. Recall that location and scale changes are not relevant in correlation discussions, so we could easily change the values of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) to be more representative of a business data set. How strong is the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) for the lottery data? Graphically, the response is a scatter plot, as in Figure 2.2. Numerically, the main response is the correlation coefficient which turns out to be \\(r\\) = 0.886 for this data set. We interpret this statistic by saying that SALES and POP are (positively) correlated. The strength of the relationship is strong because \\(r\\) = 0.886 is close to one. In summary, we may describe this relationship by saying that there is a strong correlation between SALES and POP. Method of Least Squares Now we begin to explore the question, “Can knowledge of population help us understand sales?” To respond to this question, we identify sales as the response, or dependent, variable. The population variable, which is used to help understand sales, is called the explanatory, or independent, variable. Suppose that we have available the sample data of fifty sales \\(\\{y_1, \\ldots, y_{50} \\}\\) and your job is to predict the sales of a randomly selected ZIP code. Without knowledge of the population variable, a sensible predictor is simply \\(\\overline{y}=6,495\\), the average of the available sample. Naturally, you anticipate that areas with larger populations will have larger sales. That is, if you also have knowledge of population, then can this estimate be improved? If so, then by how much? To answer these questions, the first step assumes an approximate linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). To fit a line to our data set, we use the method of least squares. We need a general technique so that, if different analysts agree on the data and agree on the fitting technique, then they will agree on the line. If different analysts fit a data set using eyeball approximations, in general they will arrive at different lines, even using the same data set. The method begins with the line \\(y=b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x\\), where the intercept and slope, \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\), are merely generic values. For the \\(i\\)th observation, \\(y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right)\\) represents the deviation of the observed value \\(y_i\\) from the line at \\(x_i\\). The quantity \\[ SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) ^{2} \\] represents the sum of squared deviations for this candidate line. The least squares method consists of determining the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\) that minimize \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})\\). This is an easy problem that can be solved by calculus, as follows. Taking partial derivatives with respect to each argument yields \\[ \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_0^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-2)\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) \\] and \\[ \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_1^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-2x_i)\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) . \\] The reader is invited to take second partial derivatives to ensure that we are minimizing, not maximizing, this function. Setting these quantities equal to zero  and canceling constant terms yields \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) =0 \\] and \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) \\right) =0, \\] which are known as the normal equations. Solving these equations yields the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_1^{\\ast}\\) that minimize the sum of squares, as follows. Definition. The least squares intercept and slope estimates are \\[ b_1=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}~~~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~~~b_0=\\overline{y}-b_1 \\overline{x}. \\] The line that they determine, \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\), is called the fitted regression line. We have dropped the asterisk, or star, notation because \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\) are no longer “candidate” values. Does this procedure yield a sensible line for our Wisconsin lottery sales? Earlier, we computed \\(r=0.886\\). From this and the basic summary statistics in Table 2.1, we have \\(b_1 = 0.886 \\left( 8,103\\right) /11,098=0.647\\) and \\(b_0 = 6,495-(0.647)9,311 = 469.7.\\) This yields the fitted regression line \\[ \\widehat{y} = 469.7 + (0.647)x. \\] The carat, or “hat,” on top of the \\(y\\) reminds us that this \\(\\widehat{y}\\), or \\(\\widehat{SALES}\\), is a fitted value. One application of the regression line is to estimate sales for a specific population say, \\(x=10,000\\). The estimate is the height of the regression line, which is \\(469.7 + (0.647)(10,000) = 6,939.7\\). Example: Summarizing Simulations. Regression analysis is a tool for summarizing complex data. In practical work, actuaries often simulate complicated financial scenarios; it is often overlooked that regression can be used to summarize relationships of interest. To illustrate, Manistre and Hancock (2005) simulated many realizations of a 10-year European put option and demonstrated the relationship between two actuarial risk measures, the value-at-risk (VaR) and the conditional tail expectation (CTE). For one example, these authors examined lognormally distributed stock returns with an initial stock price of $100, so that in 10 years the price of the stock would be distributed as \\[ S(Z)=100 \\exp \\left( (.08) 10 + .15 \\sqrt{10} Z \\right), \\] based on an annual mean return of 8%, standard deviation 15% and the outcome from a standard normal random variable \\(Z\\). The put option pays the difference between the strike price, that will be taken to be 110 for this example, and \\(S(Z)\\). The present value of this option is \\[ C(Z)= \\mathrm{e}^{-0.06(10)} \\mathrm{max} \\left(0, 110-S(Z) \\right), \\] based on a 6% discount rate. To estimate the VaR and CTE, for each \\(i\\), 1000 i.i.d. standard normal random variables were simulated and used to calculate 1000 present values, \\(C_{i1}, \\ldots, C_{i,1000}.\\) The 95th percentile of these present values is the estimate of the value at risk, denoted as \\(VaR_i.\\) The average of the highest 50 (\\(= (1-.05) \\times 1000\\)) of the present values is the estimate of the conditional tail expectation, denoted as \\(CTE_i\\). Manistre and Hancock (2005) performed this calculation \\(i=1, \\ldots, 1000\\) times; the result is presented in Figure 2.3. The scatterplot shows a strong but not perfect relationship between the \\(VaR\\) and the \\(CTE\\), the correlation coefficient turns out to be \\(r=0.782\\).

To infer general relationships, we need models to represent outcomes of broad populations. This chapter focuses on a “basic linear regression” model. The “linear regression” part comes from the fact that we fit a line to the data. The “basic” part is because we use only one explanatory variable, \\(x\\). This model is also known as a “simple” linear regression. This text avoids this language because it gives the false impression that regression ideas and interpretations with one explanatory variable are always straightforward. We now introduce two sets of assumptions of the basic model, the “observables” and the “error” representations. They are equivalent but each will help us as we later extend regression models beyond the basics. \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\hline &amp;\\textbf{Basic Linear Regression Model} \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{Observables Representation Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline \\text{F1}. &amp; \\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i . \\\\ \\text{F2}. &amp; \\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\} \\text{ are non-stochastic variables}. \\\\ \\text{F3}. &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma ^{2}. \\\\ \\text{F4}. &amp; \\{ y_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables}. \\\\ \\hline\\ \\end{array} } \\] The “observables representation” focuses on variables that we can see (or observe), \\((x_i,y_i)\\). Inference about the distribution of \\(y\\) is conditional on the observed explanatory variables, so that we may treat \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) as non-stochastic variables (assumption F2). When considering types of sampling mechanisms for \\((x_i,y_i)\\), it is convenient to think of a stratified random sampling scheme, where values of \\(\\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\}\\) are treated as the strata, or group. Under stratified sampling, for each unique value of \\(x_i\\), we draw a random sample from a population. To illustrate, suppose you are drawing from a database of firms to understand stock return performance (\\(y\\)) and wish to stratify based on the size of the firm. If the amount of assets is a continuous variable, then we can imagine drawing a sample of size 1 for each firm. In this way, we hypothesize a distribution of stock returns conditional on firm asset size. Digression: You will often see reports that summarize results for the “top 50 managers” or the “best 100 universities,” measured by some outcome variable. In regression applications, make sure that you do not select observations based on a dependent variable, such as the highest stock return, because this is stratifying based on the \\(y\\), not the \\(x\\). Chapter 6 will discuss sampling procedures in greater detail. Stratified sampling also provides motivation for assumption F4, the independence among responses. One can motivate assumption F1 by thinking of \\((x_i,y_i)\\) as a draw from a population, where the mean of the conditional distribution of \\(y_i\\) given {\\(x_i\\)} is linear in the explanatory variable. Assumption F3 is known as homoscedasticity that we will discuss extensively in Section 5.7. See Goldberger (1991) for additional background on this representation. A fifth assumption that is often implicitly used is: This assumption is not required for many statistical inference procedures because central limit theorems provide approximate normality for many statistics of interest. However, formal justification for some, such as \\(t\\)-statistics, do require this additional assumption. In contrast to the observables representation, an alternative set of assumptions focuses on the deviations, or “errors,” in the regression, defined as \\(\\varepsilon_i=y_i-\\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i \\right)\\). \\[ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\hline &amp;\\textbf{Basic Linear Regression Model} \\\\ &amp;\\textbf{Error Representation Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\hline \\text{E1}. &amp; y_i=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i . \\\\ \\text{E2}. &amp; \\{x_1,\\ldots ,x_n\\} \\text{ are non-stochastic variables}. \\\\ \\text{E3}. &amp; \\mathrm{E}~\\varepsilon _i=0 \\text{ and } \\mathrm{Var}~\\varepsilon _i=\\sigma ^{2}. \\\\ \\text{E4}. &amp; \\{ \\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables}. \\\\ \\hline\\ \\end{array} } \\] The “error representation” is based on the Gaussian theory of errors (see Stigler, 1986, for a historical background). Assumption E1 assumes that \\(y\\) is in part due to a linear function of the observed explanatory variable, \\(x\\). Other unobserved variables that influence the measurement of \\(y\\) are interpreted to be included in the “error” term \\(\\varepsilon _i\\), which is also known as the “disturbance” term. The independence of errors, E4, can be motivated by assuming that {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are realized through a simple random sample from an unknown population of errors. Assumptions E1-E4 are equivalent to F1-F4. The error representation provides a useful springboard for motivating goodness of fit measures (Section 2.3). However, a drawback of the error representation is that it draws the attention from the observable quantities \\((x_i,y_i)\\) to an unobservable quantity, {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)}. To illustrate, the sampling basis, viewing {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} as a simple random sample, is not directly verifiable because one cannot directly observe the sample {$ _i$}. Moreover, the assumption of additive errors in E1 will be troublesome when we consider nonlinear regression models. Figure 2.4 illustrates some of the assumptions of the basic linear regression model. The data (\\(x_1,y_1\\)), (\\(x_2,y_2\\)) and (\\(x_3,y_3\\)) are observed and are represented by the circular opaque plotting symbols. According to the model, these observations should be close to the regression line \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\). Each deviation from the line is random. We will often assume that the distribution of deviations may be represented by a normal curve, as in Figure 2.4. Figure 2.4: The distribution of the response varies by the level of the explanatory variable. The basic linear regression model assumptions describe the underlying population. Table 2.2 highlights the idea that characteristics of this population can be summarized by the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). In Section 2.1, we summarized data from a sample, introducing the statistics \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). Section 2.3 will introduce \\(s^{2}\\), the statistic corresponding to the parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). Table 2.2.

Some Basic Summary Measures Although statistics is the science of summarizing data, it is also the art of arguing with data. This section develops some of the basic tools used to justify the basic linear regression model. A scatter plot may provide strong visual evidence that \\(x\\) influences \\(y\\); developing numerical evidence will enable us to quantify the strength of the relationship. Further, numerical evidence will be useful when we consider other data sets where the graphical evidence is not compelling. 2.3.1 Partitioning the Variability The squared deviations, \\(\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2\\), provide a basis for measuring the spread of the data. If we wish to estimate the \\(i\\)th dependent variable without knowledge of \\(x\\), then \\(\\overline{y}\\) is an appropriate estimate and \\(y_i- \\overline{y}\\) represents the deviation of the estimate. We use \\(Total~SS=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2\\), the total sum of squares, to represent the variation in all of the responses. Suppose now that we also have knowledge of \\(x\\), an explanatory variable. Using the fitted regression line, for each observation we can compute the corresponding fitted value, \\(\\widehat{y}_i = b_0 + b_1x_i\\). The fitted value is our estimate with knowledge of the explanatory variable. As before, the difference between the response and the fitted value, \\(y_i- \\widehat{y}_i\\), represents the deviation of this estimate. We now have two “estimates” of \\(y_i\\), these are \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) and \\(\\overline{y}\\). Presumably, if the regression line is useful, then $ _i$ is a more accurate measure than \\(\\overline{y}\\). To judge this usefulness, we algebraically decompose the total deviation as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\underbrace{y_i-\\overline{y}} &amp; = &amp; \\underbrace{y_i-\\widehat{y}_i} &amp; + &amp; \\underbrace{\\widehat{y}_i-\\overline{y}} \\\\ \\text{total} &amp; = &amp; \\text{unexplained} &amp; + &amp; \\text{explained} \\\\ \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} \\\\ \\end{array} \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Interpret this equation as “the deviation without knowledge of \\(x\\) equals the deviation with knowledge of \\(x\\) plus the deviation explained by \\(x\\).” Figure 2.5 is a geometric display of this decomposition. In the figure, an observation above the line was chosen, yielding a positive deviation from the fitted regression line, to make the graph easier to read. A good exercise is to draw a rough sketch corresponding to Figure 2.5 with an observation below the fitted regression line. Figure 2.5: Geometric display of the deviation decomposition. Now, from the algebraic decomposition in equation (2.1), square each side of the equation and sum over all observations. After a little algebraic manipulation, this yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) ^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) ^2+\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\widehat{y}_i- \\overline{y}\\right) ^2. \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] We rewrite this as \\(Total~SS=Error~SS+Regression~SS\\) where \\(SS\\) stands for sum of squares. We interpret: \\(Total~SS\\) as the total variation without knowledge of \\(x\\), \\(Error~SS\\) as the total variation remaining after the introduction of \\(x\\), and \\(Regression~SS\\) as the difference between the \\(Total~SS\\) and \\(Error~SS\\) , or the total variation “explained” through knowledge of \\(x\\). When squaring the right-hand side of equation (2.1), we have the cross-product term \\(2\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) \\left( \\widehat{y}_i-\\overline{y}\\right)\\). With the “algebraic manipulation,” one can check that the sum of the cross-products over all observations is zero. This result is not true for all fitted lines but is a special property of the least squares fitted line. In many instances, the variability decomposition is reported through only a single statistic. Definition. The coefficient of determination is denoted by the symbol \\(R^2\\), called “\\(R\\)-square, and defined as \\[ R^2=\\frac{Regression~SS}{Total~SS}. \\] We interpret \\(R^2\\) to be the proportion of variability explained by the regression line. In one extreme case where the regression line fits the data perfectly, we have \\(Error~SS=0\\) and \\(R^2=1\\). In the other extreme case where the regression line provides no information about the response, we have \\(Regression~SS=0\\) and \\(R^2=0.\\) The coefficient of determination is constrained by the inequalities \\(0 \\leq R^2 \\leq 1\\) with larger values implying a better fit. 2.3.2 The Size of a Typical Deviation: s In the basic linear regression model, the deviation of the response from the regression line, $y_i-( _0+_1x_i) $, is not an observable quantity because the parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\)  are not observed. However, by using estimators \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\), we can approximate this deviation using \\[ e_i=y_i-\\widehat{y}_i=y_i-\\left( b_0+b_1x_i\\right) , \\] known as the residual. Residuals will be critical to developing strategies for improving model specification in Section 2.6. We now show how to use the residuals to estimate \\(\\sigma ^2\\). From a first course in statistics, we know that if one could observe the deviations \\(\\varepsilon _i\\), then a desirable estimate of \\(\\sigma ^2\\) would be \\((n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\varepsilon _i-\\overline{\\varepsilon }\\right) ^2\\). Because {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are not observed, we use the following. Definition. An estimator of \\(\\sigma ^2\\), the mean square error (MSE), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} s^2=\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i{}^2. \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] The positive square root, \\(s=\\sqrt{s^2},\\) is called the residual standard deviation. Comparing the definitions of \\(s^2\\) and \\((n-1)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\varepsilon _i-\\overline{\\varepsilon }\\right) ^2\\), you will see two important differences. First, in defining \\(s^2\\) we have not subtracted the average residual from each residual before squaring. This is because the average residual is zero, a special property of least squares estimation (see Exercise 2.14). This result can be shown using algebra and is guaranteed for all data sets. Second, in defining \\(s^2\\) we have divided by \\(n-2\\) instead of \\(n-1\\). Intuitively, dividing by either \\(n\\) or \\(n-1\\) tends to underestimate \\(\\sigma ^2\\). The reason is that, when fitting lines to data, we need at least two observations to determine a line. For example, we must have at least three observations for there to be any variability about a line. How much “freedom” is there for variability about a line? We will say that the error degrees of freedom is the number of observations available, \\(n\\), minus the number of observations needed to determine a line, 2 (with symbols, \\(df=n-2\\)). However, as we saw in the least squares estimation subsection, we do not need to identify two actual observations to determine a line. The idea is that if an analyst knows the line and \\(n-2\\) observations, then the remaining two observations can be determined, without variability. When dividing by \\(n-2\\), it can be shown that \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma ^2\\). We can also express \\(s^2\\) in terms of the sum of squares quantities. That is, \\[ s^2=\\frac{1}{n-2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\widehat{y}_i\\right) ^2= \\frac{Error~SS}{n-2}=MSE. \\] This leads us to the analysis of variance, or ANOVA, table: \\[ \\begin{array}{llcl} \\hline \\hline \\text{ANOVA Table} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Source} &amp; \\text{Sum of Squares} &amp; df &amp; \\text{Mean Square} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Regression} &amp; Regression~SS &amp; 1 &amp; Regression~MS \\\\ \\text{Error} &amp; Error~SS &amp; n-2 &amp; MSE \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; Total~SS &amp; n-1 &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{array} \\] The ANOVA table is merely a bookkeeping device used to keep track of the sources of variability; it routinely appears in statistical software packages as part of the regression output. The mean square column figures are defined to be the sums of square (\\(SS\\)) figures divided by their respective degrees of freedom (\\(df\\)). In particular, the mean square for errors (\\(MSE\\)) equals $ s^2$ and the regression sum of squares equals the regression mean square. This latter property is specific to the regression with one variable case; it is not true where we consider more than one explanatory variable. The error degrees of freedom in the ANOVA table is \\(n-2\\). The total degrees of freedom is \\(n-1\\), reflecting the fact that the total sum of squares is centered about the mean (at least two observations are required for positive variability). The single degree of freedom associated with the regression portion means that the slope, plus one observation, is enough information to determine the line. This is because it takes two observations to determine a line and at least three observations for there to be any variability about the line. The analysis of variance table for the lottery data is: Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square Regression 2,527,165,015 1 2,527,165,015 Error 690,116,755 48 14,377,432 Total 3,217,281,770 49 R Code to Produce Lottery ANOVA Table #Lot &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CSVData/WiscLottery.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) model.basiclinearreg&lt;-lm(Lot$SALES ~ Lot$POP) #summary(model.basiclinearreg) ANOVA &lt;- anova(model.basiclinearreg) row1 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[1], ANOVA$`Df`[1], ANOVA$`Mean Sq`[1]) row2 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[2], ANOVA$`Df`[2], ANOVA$`Mean Sq`[2]) row3 &lt;- c(ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[1]+ANOVA$`Sum Sq`[2], ANOVA$`Df`[1] +ANOVA$`Df`[2], NaN) ANOVATable &lt;- rbind(row1, row2, row3) ANOVATable1 &lt;- format(round(ANOVATable, digits = 0), big.mark = &#39;,&#39;) ANOVATable1[3,3] &lt;- &quot;&quot; rownames(ANOVATable1) &lt;- c(&quot;Regression&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, &quot;Total&quot;) colnames(ANOVATable1) &lt;- c(&quot;Sum of Squares&quot;, &quot;$df$&quot;, &quot;Mean Square&quot;) kable(ANOVATable1, align = &#39;r&#39;) %&gt;% kable_styling(position = &quot;center&quot;, full_width = FALSE) %&gt;% kableExtra::kable_classic(font = 12, html_font = &quot;Cambria&quot;) From this table, you can check that \\(R^2=78.5\\%\\) and \\(s=3,792.\\) 2.4 Properties of Regression Coefficient Estimators The least squares estimates can be expressed as weighted sum of the responses. To see this, define the weights \\[ w_i=\\frac{x_i-\\overline{x}}{s_x^2(n-1)}. \\] Because the sum of \\(x\\)-deviations (\\(x_i-\\overline{x}\\)) is zero, we see that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i=0\\). Thus, we can express the slope estimate \\[\\begin{equation} b_1=r\\frac{s_y}{s_x}=\\frac{1}{(n-1)s_x^2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) \\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_iy_i. \\tag{2.4} \\end{equation}\\] The exercises ask the reader to verify that \\(b_0\\) can also be expressed as a weighted sum of responses, so our discussion pertains to both regression coefficients. Because regression coefficients are weighted sums of responses, they can be affected dramatically by unusual observations (see Section 2.6). Because \\(b_1\\) is a weighted sum, it is straightforward to derive the expectation and variance of this statistic. By the linearity of expectations and Assumption F1, we have \\[ \\mathrm{E}~b_1=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i~\\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i+\\beta_1\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i=\\beta_1. \\] That is, \\(b_1\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\beta_1\\). Here, the sum \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i\\) \\(=\\) \\(\\left[ s_x^2(n-1)\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) x_i\\) \\(=\\left[s_x^2(n-1)\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) ^2=1.\\) From the definition of the weights, some easy algebra also shows that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i^2=1/\\left( s_x^2(n-1)\\right)\\). Further, the independence of the responses implies that the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances, and thus we have \\[ \\mathrm{Var}~b_1 =\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i^2\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\frac{\\sigma^2}{s_x^2(n-1)}. \\] Replacing \\(\\sigma ^2\\) by its estimator \\(s^2\\) and taking square roots leads to the following. Definition. The standard error of \\(b_1\\), the estimated standard deviation of \\(b_1\\), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} se(b_1)=\\frac{s}{s_x\\sqrt{n-1}}. \\tag{2.5} \\end{equation}\\] This is our measure of the reliability, or precision, of the slope estimator. Using equation (2.5), we see that \\(se(b_1)\\) is determined by three quantities, \\(n\\), \\(s\\) and \\(s_x\\), as follows: If we have more observations so that \\(n\\) becomes larger, then $ se(b_1)$ becomes smaller, other things equal. If the observations have a greater tendency to lie closer to the line so that \\(s\\) becomes smaller, then \\(se(b_1)\\) becomes smaller, other things equal. If values of the explanatory variable become more spread out so that $ s_x$ increases, then \\(se(b_1)\\) becomes smaller, other things equal. Smaller values of \\(se(b_1)\\) offer a better opportunity to detect relations between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). Figure 2.6 illustrates these relationships. Here, the scatter plot in the middle has the smallest value of \\(se(b_1)\\). Compared with the middle plot, the left-hand plot has a larger value of \\(s\\) and thus \\(se(b_1)\\). Compared with the right-hand plot, the middle plot has a larger \\(s_x\\), and thus smaller value of \\(se(b_1)\\). Figure 2.6: These three scatter plots exhibit the same linear relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). The plot on the left exhibits greater variability about the line than the plot in the middle. The plot on the right exhibits a smaller standard deviation in \\(x\\) than the plot in the middle.

That is, recall from mathematical statistics that linear combinations of normal random variables are also normal. Thus, if Assumption F5 holds, then \\(b_1\\) is normally distributed. Moreover, several versions of central limit theorems exists for weighted sums (see, for example, Serfling, 1980). Thus, as discussed in Section 1.4, if the responses \\(y_i\\) are even approximately normally distributed, then it will be reasonable to use a normal approximation for the sampling distribution of \\(b_1\\). Using \\(se(b_1)\\) as the estimated standard deviation of \\(b_1\\), for large values of \\(n\\) we have that \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) has an approximate standard normal distribution. Although we will not prove it here, under Assumption F5 \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) follows a $t $-distribution with degrees of freedom \\(df=n-2\\). 2.5 Statistical Inference Having fit a model with a data set, we can make a number of important statements. Generally, it is useful to think about these statements in three categories: (i) tests of hypothesized ideas, (ii) estimates of model parameters and (ii) predictions of new outcomes. 2.5.1 Is the Explanatory Variable Important?: The t-Test We respond to the question of whether the explanatory variable is important by investigating whether or not \\(\\beta_1=0\\). The logic is that if \\(\\beta_1=0\\), then the basic linear regression model no longer includes an explanatory variable \\(x\\). Thus, we translate our question of the importance of the explanatory variable into a narrower question that can be answered using the hypothesis testing framework. This narrower question is, is $ H_0:_1=0$ valid? We respond to this question by looking at the test statistic: \\[ t-\\mathrm{ratio}=\\frac{\\mathrm{estimator-hypothesized~value~of~parameter}} {\\mathrm{standard~error~of~the~estimator}}. \\] For the case of \\(H_0:\\beta_1=0\\) , we examine \\(t\\)-ratio \\(t(b_1)=b_1/se(b_1)\\) because the hypothesized value of \\(\\beta_1\\) is 0. This is the appropriate standardization because, under the null hypothesis and the model assumptions described in Section 2.4, the sampling distribution of \\(t(b_1)\\) can be shown to be the \\(t\\)-distribution with $ df=n-2$ degrees of freedom. Thus, to test the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) against the alternative \\(H_{a}:\\beta_1\\neq 0\\), we reject \\(H_0\\) if favor of \\(H_{a}\\) if \\(|t(b_1)|\\) exceeds a \\(t\\)-value. Here, this \\(t\\)-value is a percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution using \\(df=n-2\\) degrees of freedom.  We denote the significance level as $$  and this \\(t\\)-value as \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\). Example: Lottery Sales - Continued. For the lottery sales example, the residual standard deviation is \\(s=3,792\\). From Table 2.1, we have \\(s_x = 11,098\\). Thus, the standard error of the slope is \\(se(b_1) = 3792/(11098\\sqrt{50-1})=0.0488\\). From Section 2.1, the slope estimate is \\(b_1=0.647\\). Thus, the \\(t\\)-statistic is \\(t(b_1) = 0.647/0.0488 = 13.4\\). We interpret this by saying that the slope is 13.4 standard errors above zero. For the significance level, we use the customary value of \\(\\alpha\\) = 5%. The 97.5th percentile from a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=50-2=48\\) degrees of freedom is \\(t_{48,0.975}=2.011\\). Because \\(|13.4|&gt;2.011\\), we reject the null hypothesis that the slope \\(\\beta_1 = 0\\) in favor of the alternative that \\(\\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). Making decisions by comparing a \\(t\\)-ratio to a \\(t\\)-value is called a \\(t\\)-test. Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1=0\\) versus \\(H_{a}:\\beta_1\\neq 0\\) is just one of many hypothesis tests that can be performed, although it is the most common. Table 2.3 outlines alternative decision-making procedures. These procedures are for testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) where \\(d\\) is a user-prescribed value that may be equal to zero or any other known value. For example, in our Section 2.7 example, we will use \\(d=1\\) to test financial theories about the stock market. Table 2.3 Decision-Making Procedures for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{c|c} \\hline \\text{Alternative Hypothesis} (H_{a}) &amp; \\text{Procedure: Reject } H_0 \\text{ in favor of } H_{a} \\text{ if} \\\\ \\hline \\beta_1&gt;d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&gt;t_{n-2,1-\\alpha }. \\\\ \\beta_1&lt;d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&lt;-t_{n-2,1-\\alpha }. \\\\ \\beta_1\\neq d &amp; |t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}&gt;t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}. \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\text{Notes: The significance level is } \\alpha . \\text{Here, }t_{n-2,1-\\alpha} \\text{ the } (1-\\alpha )th \\text{ percentile}\\\\ ~~\\text{from the } t-\\text{distribution using } df=n-2 \\text{ degrees of freedom}.\\\\ ~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_1 -d)/se(b_1) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Alternatively, one can construct probability (\\(p\\)-) values and compare these to given significant levels. The \\(p\\)-value is a useful summary statistic for the data analyst to report since it allows the report reader to understand the strength of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Table 2.4 summarizes the procedure for calculating \\(p\\)-values. Table 2.4 Probability Values for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_1 = d\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{c|ccc} \\hline \\text{Alternative} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Hypothesis} (H_a) &amp; \\beta_1&gt;d &amp; \\beta_1&lt;d &amp; \\beta_1\\neq d \\\\ \\hline p-value &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-2}&gt;t-\\mathrm{ratio}) &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-2}&lt;t-\\mathrm{ratio}) &amp; \\Pr (|t_{n-2}|&gt;|t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}) \\\\\\hline \\end{array} \\\\ {\\small \\begin{array}{l} \\hline \\text{Notes: Here, }t_{n-2} \\text{ is a } t-\\text{distributed random variable with } df=n-2 \\text{ degrees of freedom.}\\\\ ~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_1 -d)/se(b_1) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Another interesting way of addressing the question of the importance of an explanatory variable is through the correlation coefficient. Remember that the correlation coefficient is a measure of linear relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Let’s denote this statistic by \\(r(y,x)\\). This quantity is unaffected by scale changes in either variable. For example, if we multiply the \\(x\\) variable by the number \\(b_1\\), then the correlation coefficient remains unchanged. Further, correlations are unchanged by additive shifts. Thus, if we add a number, say \\(b_0\\), to each \\(x\\) variable, then the correlation coefficient remains unchanged. Using a scale change and an additive shift on the \\(x\\) variable can be used to produce the fitted value \\(\\widehat{y}=b_0+b_1x\\). Thus, using notation, we have \\(|r(y,x)|=r(y,\\widehat{y}).\\) We may thus interpret the correlation between the responses and the explanatory variable to be equal to the correlation between the responses and the fitted values. This leads then to the following interesting algebraic fact, \\(R^2=r^2.\\) That is, the coefficient of determination equals the correlation coefficient squared. This is much easier to interpret if one thinks of \\(r\\) as the correlation between observed and fitted values. See Exercise 2.13 for steps useful in confirming this result. 2.5.2 Confidence Intervals Investigators often cite the formal hypothesis testing mechanism to respond to the question “Does the explanatory variable have a real influence on the response?” A natural follow-up question is “To what extent does \\(x\\) affect \\(y\\)?” To a certain degree, one could respond using the size of the \\(t\\)-ratio or the \\(p\\)-value. However, in many instances a confidence interval for the slope is more useful. To introduce confidence intervals for the slope, recall that \\(b_1\\) is our point estimator of the true, unknown slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Section 2.4 argued that this estimator has standard error \\(se(b_1)\\) and that \\(\\left( b_1-\\beta_1\\right) /se(b_1)\\) follows a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-2\\) degrees of freedom. Probability statements can be inverted to yield confidence intervals. Using this logic, we have the following confidence interval for the slope \\(\\beta_1\\). Definition. A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% confidence interval for the slope \\(\\beta_1\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} b_1\\pm t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2} ~se(b_1). \\tag{2.6} \\end{equation}\\] As with hypothesis testing, \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\) is the (1-$ $/2)th percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-2\\) degrees of freedom. Because of the two-sided nature of confidence intervals, the percentile is 1 - (1 - confidence level) / 2. In this text, for notational simplicity we generally use a 95% confidence interval, so the percentile is 1-(1-0.95)/2 = 0.975. The confidence interval provides a range of reliability that measures the usefulness of the estimate. In Section 2.1, we established that the least squares slope estimate for the lottery sales example is \\(b_1=0.647\\). The interpretation is that if a zip code’s population differs by 1,000, then we expect mean lottery sales to differ by $647. How reliable is this estimate? It turns out that \\(se(b_1)=0.0488\\) and thus an approximate 95% confidence interval for the slope is \\[ 0.647\\pm (2.011)(.0488), \\] or (0.549, 0.745). Similarly, if population differs by 1,000, a 95% confidence interval for the expected change in sales is (549, 745). Here, we use the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{48,0.975}=2.011\\) because there are 48 (= $ n$-2) degrees of freedom and, for a 95% confidence interval, we need the 97.5th percentile. 2.5.3 Prediction Intervals In Section 2.1, we showed how to use least squares estimators to predict the lottery sales for a zip code, outside of our sample, having a population of 10,000. Because prediction is such an important task for actuaries, we formalize the procedure so that it can be used on a regular basis. To predict an additional observation, we assume that the level of explanatory variable is known and is denoted by \\(x_{\\ast}\\). For example, in our previous lottery sales example we used \\(x_{\\ast} = 10,000\\). We also assume that the additional observation follows the same linear regression model as the observations in the sample. Using our least square estimators, our point prediction is \\(\\widehat{y}_{\\ast} = b_0 + b_1 x_{\\ast}\\), the height of the fitted regression line at \\(x_{\\ast}\\) We may decompose the prediction error into two parts: It can be shown that the standard error of the prediction is \\[ se(pred) = s \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\left( x_{\\ast}-\\overline{x}\\right) ^2}{(n-1)s_x^2}}. \\] As with \\(se(b_1)\\), the terms \\(n^{-1}\\) and $( x_{}- ) ^2/$ become close to zero as the sample size \\(n\\) becomes large. Thus, for large \\(n\\), we have that \\(se(pred)\\approx s\\), reflecting that the error in estimating the regression line at a point becomes negligible and deviation of the additional response from its mean becomes the entire source of uncertainty. Definition. A \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\)% prediction interval at \\(x_{\\ast}\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{y}_{\\ast} \\pm t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2} ~se(pred) \\tag{2.7} \\end{equation}\\] where the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{n-2,1-\\alpha /2}\\) is the same as used for hypothesis testing and the confidence interval. For example, the point prediction at \\(x_{\\ast} = 10,000\\) is \\(\\widehat{y}_{\\ast}\\)= 469.7 + 0.647 (10000) = 6,939.7. The standard error of this prediction is \\[ se(pred) = 3,792 \\sqrt{1+\\frac{1}{50} + \\frac{\\left( 10,000-9,311\\right)^2}{(50-1)(11,098)^2}} = 3,829.6. \\] With a \\(t\\)-value equal to 2.011, this yields an approximate 95% prediction interval \\[ 6,939.7 \\pm (2.011)(3,829.6) = 6,939.7 \\pm 7,701.3 = (-761.6, ~14,641.0). \\] We interpret these results by first pointing out that our best estimate of lottery sales for a zip code with a population of 10,000 is 6,939.70. Our 95% prediction interval represents a range of reliability for this prediction. If we could see many zip codes, each with a population of 10,000, on average we expect about 19 out of 20, or 95%, would have lottery sales between 0 and 14,641. It is customary to truncate the lower bound of the prediction interval to zero if negative values of the response are deemed to be inappropriate.

Statistics takes this one step further, using discrepancies between the assumptions and the data to improve model specification. We will examine the Section 2.2 modeling assumptions in light of the data and use any mismatch to specify a better model; this process is known as diagnostic checking (like when you go to a doctor and he or she performs diagnostic routines to check your health). We will begin with the Section 2.2 error representation. Under this set of assumptions, the deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} are identically and independently distributed (i.i.d), and under assumption F5, normally distributed. To assess the validity of these assumptions, one uses (observed) residuals {\\(e_i\\)} as approximations for the (unobserved) deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)}. The basic theme is that if the residuals are related to a variable or display any other recognizable pattern, then we should be able to take advantage of this information and improve our model specification. The residuals should contain little or no information and represent only natural variation from the sampling that cannot be attributed to any specific source. Residual analysis is the exercise of checking the residuals for patterns. There are five types of model discrepancies that analysts commonly look for. If detected, the discrepancies can be corrected with the appropriate adjustments in the model specification. Model Misspecification Issues Lack of Independence. There may exist relationships among the deviations {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} so that they are not independent. Heteroscedasticity. Assumption E3 that indicates that all observations have a common (although unknown) variability, known as homoscedasticity. Heteroscedascity is the term used when the variability varies by observation. Relationships between Model Deviations and Explanatory Variables. If an explanatory variable has the ability to help explain the deviation $$, then one should be able to use this information to better predict \\(y\\). Nonnormal Distributions. If the distribution of the deviation represents a serious departure from normality, then the usual inference procedures are no longer valid. Unusual Points. Individual observations may have a large effect on the regression model fit, meaning that the results may be sensitive to the impact of a single observation. \\end{enumerate} This list will serve the reader throughout your study of regression analysis. Of course, with only an introduction to basic models we have not yet seen alternative models that might be used when we encounter these model discrepancies. In this book’s Part II on time series models, we will study lack of independence among data ordered over time. Chapter 5 will consider heteroscedasticity in further detail. The introduction to multiple linear regression in Chapter 3 will be our first look at handling relationships between {\\(\\varepsilon _i\\)} and additional explanatory variables. We have, however, already had an introduction to the effect of normal distributions, seeing that \\(qq\\) plots can detect non-normality and that transformations can help induce approximate normality. In this section, we discuss the effects of unusual points. Much of residual analysis is done by examining a standardized residual, a residual divided by its standard error. An approximate standard error of the residual is \\(s\\); in Chapter 3 we will give a precise mathematical definition. There are two reasons why we often examine standardized residuals in lieu of basic residuals. First, if responses are normally distributed, then standardized residuals are approximately realizations from a standard normal distribution. This provides a reference distribution to compare values of standardized residuals. For example, if a standardized residual exceeds two in absolute value, this is considered unusually large and the observation is called an outlier. Second, because standardized residuals are dimensionless, we get carryover of experience from one data set to another. This is true regardless of whether or not the normal reference distribution is applicable. Outliers and High Leverage Points Another important part of residual analysis is the identification of unusual observations in a data set. Because regression estimates are weighted averages with weights that vary by observation, some observations are more important than others. This weighting is more important than many users of regression analysis realize. In fact, the example below demonstrates that a single observation can have a dramatic effect in a large data set. There are two directions in which a data point can be unusual, the horizontal and vertical directions. By “unusual,” we mean that an observation under consideration seems to be far from the majority of the data set. An observation that is unusual in the vertical direction is called an outlier. An observation that is unusual in the horizontal directional is called a high leverage point. An observation may be both an outlier and a high leverage point. Example: Outliers and High Leverage Points. Consider the fictitious data set of 19 points plus three points, labeled A, B, and C, given in Figure 2.7 and Table 2.5. Think of the first 19 points as “good” observations that represent some type of phenomena. We want to investigate the effect of adding a single aberrant point.

The first regression is for the nineteen base points. The other three regressions use the nineteen base points plus each type of unusual observation. Table 2.6.

The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), indicates about 89% of the variability has been explained by the line. The size of the typical error, \\(s\\), is about 0.29, small compared to the scatter in the \\(y\\)-values. Further, the \\(t\\)-ratio for the slope coefficient is large. When the outlier point A is added to the nineteen base points, the situation deteriorates dramatically. The \\(R^2\\) drops from 89% to 53.7% and \\(s\\) increases from about 0.29 to about 0.85. The fitted regression line itself does not change that much even though our confidence in the estimates has decreased. An outlier is unusual in the \\(y\\)-value, but “unusual in the \\(y\\)-value” depends on the \\(x\\)-value. To see this, keep the \\(y\\)-value of Point A the same, but increase the \\(x\\)-value and call the point B. When the point B is added to the nineteen base points, the regression line provides a better fit. Point B is close to being on the line of the regression fit generated by the nineteen base points. Thus, the fitted regression line and the size of the typical error, \\(s\\), do not change much. However, \\(R^2\\) increases from 89% to nearly 95 percent. If we think of $ R^2$ as \\(1-(Error~SS)/(Total~SS)\\), by adding point B we have increased $ Total~SS$, the total squared deviations in the \\(y\\)’s, even though leaving $ Error~SS$ relatively unchanged. Point B is not an outlier, but it is a high leverage point. To show how influential this point is, drop the \\(y\\)-value considerably and call this the new point C. When this point is added to the nineteen base points, the situation deteriorates dramatically. The \\(R^2\\) coefficient drops from 89% to 10%, and the \\(s\\) more than triples, from 0.29 to 0.87. Further, the regression line coefficients change dramatically. Most users of regression at first do not believe that one point in twenty can have such a dramatic effect on the regression fit. The fit of a regression line can always be improved by removing an outlier. If the point is a high leverage point and not an outlier, it is not clear whether the fit will be improved when the point is removed. Simply because you can dramatically improve a regression fit by omitting an observation does not mean you should always do so! The goal of data analysis is to understand the information in the data. Throughout the text, we will encounter many data sets where the unusual points provide some of the most interesting information about the data. The goal of this subsection is to recognize the effects of unusual points; Chapter 5 will provide options for handling unusual points in your analysis. All quantitative disciplines, such as accounting, economics, linear programming, and so on, practice the art of sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a description of the global changes in a system due to a small local change in an element of the system. Examining the effects of individual observations on the regression fit is a type of sensitivity analysis. Example: Lottery Sales – Continued. Figure 2.8 exhibits an outlier; the point in the upper left-hand side of the plot represents a zip code that includes Kenosha, Wisconsin. Sales for this zip code are unusually high given its population. Kenosha is close to the Illinois border; residents from Illinois probably participate in the Wisconsin lottery thus effectively increasing the potential pool of sales in Kenosha. Table 2.7 summarizes the regression fit both with and without this zip code. Table 2.7. Regression Results with and without Kenosha \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|rrrrr} \\hline \\text{Data} &amp; b_0 &amp; b_1 &amp; s &amp; R^2(\\%) &amp; t(b_1) \\\\ \\hline \\text{With Kenosha} &amp; 469.7 &amp; 0.647 &amp; 3,792 &amp; 78.5 &amp; 13.26 \\\\ \\text{Without Kenosha} &amp; -43.5 &amp; 0.662 &amp; 2,728 &amp; 88.3 &amp; 18.82 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Figure 2.8: Scatter plot of SALES versus POP, with the outlier corresponding to Kenosha marked.

Both slope estimates are qualitatively similar and the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistics are very high, well above cut-offs for statistical significance. However, there are dramatic differences when assessing the quality of the fit. The coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), increased from 78.5% to 88.3% when deleting Kenosha. Moreover, our “typical deviation” \\(s\\) dropped by over $1,000. This is particularly important if we wish to tighten our prediction intervals. To check the accuracy of our assumptions, it is also customary to check the normality assumption. One way of doing this is the \\(qq\\) plot, introduced in Section 1.2. The two panels in Figures 2.9 are \\(qq\\) plots with and without the Kenosha zip code. Recall that points “close” to linear indicate approximate normality. In the right-hand panel of Figure 2.9, the sequence does appear to be linear so that residuals are approximately normally distributed. This is not the case in the left-hand panel, where the sequence of points appears to climb dramatically for large quantiles. The interesting thing is that the non-normality of the distribution is due to a single outlier, not a pattern of skewness that is common to all the observations.

The name is something of a misnomer in that the model is really about returns based on capital assets, not the prices themselves. The types of assets that we examine are equity securities that are traded on an active market, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). For a stock on the exchange, we can relate returns to prices through the following expression: \\[ \\small{ \\mathrm{return=}\\frac{\\mathrm{ price~at~the~end~of~a~period+dividends-price~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}}{ \\mathrm{price~at~the~beginning~of~a~period}}. } \\] If we can estimate the returns that a stock generates, then knowledge of the price at the beginning of a generic financial period allows us to estimate the value at the end of the period (ending price plus dividends). Thus, we follow standard practice and model returns of a security. An intuitively appealing idea, and one of the basic characteristics of the CAPM, is that there should be a relationship between the performance of a security and the market. One rationale is simply that if economic forces are such that the market improves, then those same forces should act upon an individual stock, suggesting that it also improve. As noted above, we measure performance of a security through the return. To measure performance of the market, several market indices exist that summarize the performance of each exchange. We will use the “equally-weighted” index of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 is the collection of the 500 largest companies traded on the NYSE, where “large” is identified by Standard &amp; Poor’s, a financial services rating organization. The equally-weighted index is defined by assuming a portfolio is created by investing one dollar in each of the 500 companies. Another rationale for a relationship between security and market returns comes from financial economics theory. This is the CAPM theory, attributed to Sharpe (1964) and Lintner (1965) and based on the portfolio diversification ideas of Harry Markowitz (1959). Other things equal, investors would like to select a return with a high expected value and low standard deviation, the latter being a measure of risk. One of the desirable properties about using standard deviations as a measure of riskiness is that it is straight-forward to calculate the standard deviation of a portfolio. One only needs to know the standard deviation of each security and the correlations among securities. A notable security is a risk-free one, that is, a security that theoretically has a zero standard deviation. Investors often use a 30-day U.S. Treasury bill as an approximation of a risk-free security, arguing that the probability of default of the U.S. government within 30 days is negligible. Positing the existence of a risk-free asset and some other mild conditions, under the CAPM theory there exists an efficient frontier called the securities market line. This frontier specifies the minimum expected return that investors should demand for a specified level of risk. To estimate this line, we can use the equation \\[ \\mathrm{E}~r = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 r_m \\] where \\(r\\) is the security return and \\(r_m\\) is the market return. We interpret \\(\\beta_1 r_m\\) as a measure of the amount of security return that is attributed to the behavior of the market. Testing economic theory, or models arising from any discipline, involves collecting data. The CAPM theory is about ex-ante (before the fact) returns even though we can only test with ex-post (after the fact) returns. Before the fact, the returns are unknown and there is an entire distribution of returns. After the fact, there is only a single realization of the security and market return. Because at least two observations are required to determine a line, CAPM models are estimated using security and market data gathered over time. In this way, several observations can be made. For the purposes of our discussions, we follow standard practice in the securities industry and examine monthly prices. Data To illustrate, consider monthly returns over the five year period from January, 1986 to December, 1990, inclusive. Specifically, we use the security returns from the Lincoln National Insurance Corporation as the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) and the market returns from the index of the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index as the explanatory variable (\\(x\\)). At the time, the Lincoln was a large, multi-line, insurance company, headquartered in the midwest of the U.S., specifically in Fort Wayne, Indiana. Because it was well known for its’ prudent management and stability, it is a good company to begin our analysis of the relationship between the market and an individual stock. We begin by interpreting some basic summary statistics, in Table 2.8, in terms of financial theory. First, an investor in the Lincoln will be concerned that the five year average return, \\(\\overline{y}=0.00510\\), is below the return of the market, \\(\\overline{x}=0.00741\\). Students of interest theory recognize that monthly returns can be converted to an annual basis using geometric compounding. For example, the annual return of the Lincoln is \\((1.0051)^{12}-1=0.062946\\), or roughly 6.29 percent. This is compared to an annual return of 9.26% (= (1\\(00((1.00741)^{12}-1\\))) for the market. A measure of risk, or volatility, that is used in finance is the standard deviation. Thus, interpret \\(s_y\\) = 0.0859 \\(&gt;\\) 0.05254 = \\(s_x\\) to mean that an investment in the Lincoln is riskier than that of the market. Another interesting aspect of Table 2.8 is that the smallest market return, -0.22052, is 4.338 standard deviations below its average ((-0.22052-0.00741)/0.05254 = -4.338). This is highly unusual with respect to a normal distribution. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly. Create a table just to update the counter...&quot;) Table 2.2: Silly.

These are scatter plots of the returns versus time, called time series plots. In Figure 2.10, one can clearly see the smallest market return and a quick glance at the horizontal axis reveals that this unusual point is in October, 1987, the time of the well-known market crash. Figure 2.10: Time series plot of returns from the Lincoln National Corporation and the market. There are 60 monthly returns over the period January, 1986 through December, 1990. The scatter plot in Figure 2.11 graphically summarizes the relationship between Lincoln’s return and the return of the market. The market crash is clearly evident in Figure 2.11 and represents a high leverage point. With the regression line (described below) superimposed, the two outlying points that can be seen in Figure 2.10 are also evident. Despite these anomalies, the plot in Figure 2.11 does suggest that there is a linear relationship between Lincoln and market returns. Figure 2.11: Scatterplot of Lincoln’s return versus the S&amp;P 500 Index return. The regression line is superimposed, enabling us to identify the market crash and two outliers.

The fitted regression is \\[ \\widehat{LINCOLN}=-0.00214+0.973 MARKET. \\] The resulting estimated standard error, \\(s\\) = 0.0696 is lower than the standard deviation of Lincoln’s returns, \\(s_y=0.0859\\). Thus, the regression model explains some of the variability of Lincoln’s returns. Further, the \\(t\\)-statistic associated with the slope \\(b_1\\) turns out to be \\(t(b_1)=5.64\\), which is significantly large. One disappointing aspect is that the statistic \\(R^2=35.4\\%\\) can be interpreted as saying that the market explains only a little over a third of the variability. Thus, even though the market is clearly an important determinant, as evidenced by the high \\(t\\)-statistic, it provides only a partial explanation of the performance of the Lincoln’s returns. In the context of the market model, we may interpret the standard deviation of the market, \\(s_x\\), as non-diversifiable risk. Thus, the risk of a security can be decomposed into two components, the diversifiable component and the market component, which is non-diversifiable. The idea here is that by combining several securities we can create a portfolio of securities that, in most instances, will reduce the riskiness of our holdings when compared with a single security. Again, the rationale for holding a security is that we are compensated through higher expected returns by holding a security with higher riskiness. To quantify the relative riskiness, it is not hard to show that \\[\\begin{equation} s_y^2 = b_1^2 s_x^2 + s^2 \\frac{n-2}{n-1}. \\tag{2.8} \\end{equation}\\] The riskiness of a security is due to the riskiness due to the market plus the riskiness due to a diversifiable component. Note that the riskiness due to the market component, \\(s_x^2\\), is larger for securities with larger slopes. For this reason, investors think of securities with slopes \\(b_1\\) greater than one as “aggressive” and slopes less than one as “defensive.” Sensitivity Analysis The above summary immediately raises two additional issues. First, what is the effect of the October, 1987 crash on the fitted regression equation? We know that unusual observations, such as the crash, may potentially influence the fit a great deal. To this end, the regression was re-run without the observation corresponding to the crash. The motivation for this is that the October 1987 crash represents a combination of highly unusual events (the interaction of several automated trading programs operated by the large stock brokerage houses) that we do not wish to represent using the same model as our other observations. Deleting this observation, the fitted regression is \\[ \\widehat{LINCOLN} = -0.00181 + 0.956 MARKET, \\] with \\(R^2=26.4\\%\\), \\(t(b_1)=4.52\\), \\(s=0.0702\\) and \\(s_y=0.0811\\). We interpret these statistics in the same fashion as the fitted model including the October 1987 crash. It is interesting to note, however, that the proportion of variability explained has actually decreased when excluding the influential point. This serves to illustrate an important point. High leverage points are often looked upon with dread by data analysts because they are, by definition, unlike other observations in the data set and require special attention. However, when fitting relationships among variables, they also represent an opportunity because they allow the data analyst to observe the relationship between variables over broader ranges than otherwise possible. The downside is that these relationships may be nonlinear or follow an entirely different pattern when compared to the relationships observed in the main portion of the data. The second question raised by the regression analysis is what can be said about the unusual circumstances that gave rise to the unusual behavior of Lincoln’s returns in October and November of 1990. A useful feature of regression analysis is to identify and raise the question; it does not resolve it. Because the analysis clearly pinpoints two highly unusual points, it suggests to the data analyst to go back and ask some specific questions about the sources of the data. In this case, the answer is straightforward. In October of 1990, the Travelers’ Insurance Company, a competitor, announced that it would take a large write-off in their real estate portfolio. due to an unprecedented number of mortgage defaults. The market reacted quickly to this news, and investors assumed that other large stock life insurers would also soon announce large write-offs. Anticipating this news, investors tried to sell their portfolios of, for example, Lincoln’s stock, thus causing the price to plummet. However, it turned out that investors overreacted to this news and that Lincoln’s portfolio of real estate was indeed sound. Thus, prices quickly returned to their historical levels. 2.8 Illustrative Regression Computer Output Computers and statistical software packages that perform specialized calculations play a vital role in modern-day statistical analyses. Inexpensive computing capabilities have allowed data analysts to focus on relationships of interest. Specifying models that are attractive merely for their computational simplicity is much less important now compared to times before the widespread availability of inexpensive computing. An important theme of this text is to focus on relationships of interest and to rely on widely available statistical software to estimate the models that we specify. With any computer package, generally the most difficult parts of operating the package are the (i) input, (ii) using the commands and (iii) interpreting the output. You will find that most modern statistical software packages accept spreadsheet or text-based files, making input of data relatively easy. Personal computer statistical software packages have menu-driven command languages with easily accessible on-line help facilities. Once you decide what to do, finding the right commands is relatively easy. This section provides guidance in interpreting the output of statistical packages. Most statistical packages generate similar output. Below, three examples of standard statistical software packages, EXCEL, SAS and R are given. The annotation symbol “[.]” marks a statistical quantity that is described in the legend. Thus, this section provides a link between the notation used in the text and output from some of the standard statistical software packages.

By taking \\(a=-c\\), use the results in part (b) to show \\(r\\geq -1\\). Under what conditions is \\(r=-1\\)? Under what conditions is \\(r=1\\)? 2.4 Regression coefficients are weighted sums. Show that the intercept term, \\(b_0\\), can be expressed as a weighted sum of the dependent variables. That is, show that \\(b_0=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i,0}y_i.\\) Further, express the weights in terms of the slope weights, \\(w_i\\). 2.5 Another expression for the slope as a weighted sum Using algebra, establish an alternative expression \\[ b_1=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}weight_i~slope_i}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}weight_i}. \\] Here, \\(slope_i\\) is the slope between \\((x_i,y_i)\\) and \\((\\bar{x},\\bar{y})\\). Give a precise form for the weight \\(weight_i\\) as a function of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). Suppose that \\(\\bar{x} = 4,\\bar{y} = 3, x_1 = 2 \\mathrm{~and~} y_1= 6\\).

Consider the model \\(y_i=\\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon _i\\), that is, regression with one explanatory variable without the intercept term. This model is called regression through the origin because the true regression line \\(\\mathrm{E}y = \\beta_1 x\\) passes through the origin (the point (0, 0)). For this model, the least squares estimate of \\(\\beta_1\\) is that number \\(b_1\\) that minimizes the sum of squares \\(\\mathrm{SS}(b_1^{\\ast} )=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - b_1^{\\ast}x_i\\right) ^2.\\) Verify that \\[ b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2}. \\] Consider the model \\(y_i=\\beta_1 z_i^2 + \\varepsilon _i\\), a quadratic model passing through the origin.

Suppose that \\(x_i\\) only takes on the values 0 and 1. Out of the \\(n\\) observations, \\(n_1\\) take on the value \\(x=0\\). These $n_1 $ observations have an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_1\\). the remaining \\(n-n_1\\) observations have value \\(x=1\\) and an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_2\\). Use Exercise 2.8 to show that \\(b_1 = \\overline{y}_2 - \\overline{y}_1.\\) 2.10 Nursing Home Utilization.

Consider a generic sequence of pairs of numbers (\\(x_1,y_1\\)), …, (\\(x_n,y_n\\)) with the correlation coefficient computed as \\(r(y,x)=\\left[ (n-1)s_ys_x\\right] ^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\overline{y}\\right) \\left( x_i-\\overline{x}\\right) .\\) Suppose that either \\(\\overline{y}=0,\\overline{x}=0\\) or both \\(\\overline{x}\\)  and \\(\\overline{y}=0.\\) Then, check that \\(r(y,x)=0\\) implies \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i x_i=0\\) and vice-versa. Show that the correlation between the residuals and the explanatory variables is zero. Do this by using part (a) of Exercise 2.13 to show that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i e_i = 0\\) and then apply part (a). Show that the correlation between the residuals and fitted values is zero. Do this by showing that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{y}_i e_i = 0\\)  and then apply part (a). 2.16 Correlation and \\(t\\)-statistics. Use the following steps to establish a relationship between the correlation coefficient and the \\(t\\)-statistic for the slope. a Use algebra to check that \\[ R^2=1-\\frac{n-2}{n-1}\\frac{s^2}{s_y^2}. \\] Use part (a) to establish the following quick computational formula for \\(s,\\) \\[s = s_y \\sqrt{(1-r^2)\\frac{n-1}{n-2}}.\\] Use part (b) to show that \\[ t(b_1) = \\sqrt{n-2}\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{1-r^2}}. \\] Sections 2.6-2.7 2.17 Effects of an unusual point. You are analyzing a data set of size \\(n=100\\). You have just performed a regression analysis using one predictor variable and notice that the residual for the 10th observation is unusually large. Suppose that, in fact, it turns out that \\(e_{10}=8s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? Suppose that \\(e_{10}=4s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? Suppose that you reduce the data set to size \\(n=20\\). After running the regression, it turns out that we still have \\(e_{10}=4s\\). What percentage of the error sum of squares, \\(Error~SS\\), is due to the 10th observation? 2.18 Consider a data set consisting of 20 observations with the following summary statistics: \\(\\overline{x}=0\\), \\(\\overline{y}=9\\), \\(s_x=1\\) and \\(s_y=10\\). You run a regression using using one variable and determine that \\(s=7\\). Determine the standard error of a prediction at \\(x_{\\ast}=1.\\) 2.19 Summary statistics can hide important relationships. The data in Table 2.9 is due to Anscombe (1973). The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate how plotting data can reveal important information that is not evident in numerical summary statistics. Table 2.9. Anscombe’s (1973) Data \\[ \\begin{array}{c|rrrrrr} \\hline obs &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ num &amp; x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; y_2 &amp; y_3 &amp; x_2 &amp; y_4 \\\\ \\hline 1 &amp; 10 &amp; 8.04 &amp; 9.14 &amp; 7.46 &amp; 8 &amp; 6.58 \\\\ 2 &amp; 8 &amp; 6.95 &amp; 8.14 &amp; 6.77 &amp; 8 &amp; 5.76 \\\\ 3 &amp; 13 &amp; 7.58 &amp; 8.74 &amp; 12.74 &amp; 8 &amp; 7.71 \\\\ 4 &amp; 9 &amp; 8.81 &amp; 8.77 &amp; 7.11 &amp; 8 &amp; 8.84 \\\\ 5 &amp; 11 &amp; 8.33 &amp; 9.26 &amp; 7.81 &amp; 8 &amp; 8.47 \\\\ 6 &amp; 14 &amp; 9.96 &amp; 8.10 &amp; 8.84 &amp; 8 &amp; 7.04 \\\\ 7 &amp; 6 &amp; 7.24 &amp; 6.13 &amp; 6.08 &amp; 8 &amp; 5.25 \\\\ 8 &amp; 4 &amp; 4.26 &amp; 3.10 &amp; 5.39 &amp; 8 &amp; 5.56 \\\\ 9 &amp; 12 &amp; 10.84 &amp; 9.13 &amp; 8.15 &amp; 8 &amp; 7.91 \\\\ 10 &amp; 7 &amp; 4.82 &amp; 7.26 &amp; 6.42 &amp; 8 &amp; 6.89 \\\\ 11 &amp; 5 &amp; 5.68 &amp; 4.74 &amp; 5.73 &amp; 19 &amp; 12.50 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Compute the averages and standard deviations of each column of data. Check that the averages and standard deviations of each of the \\(x\\) columns are the same, within two decimal places, and similarly for each of the \\(y\\) columns. Run four regressions, (1) \\(y_{1}\\) on \\(x_{1}\\), (2) \\(y_2\\) on \\(x_{1}\\), (3) \\(y_{3}\\) on \\(x_{1}\\) and (4) \\(y_{4}\\) on \\(x_2\\).

Produce scatter plots for each of the four regression models that you fit in part (b). Discuss the fact that the fitted regression models produced in part (b) imply that the four data sets are similar although the four scatter plots produced in part (c) yield a dramatically different story. 2.20 Nursing Home Utilization. This exercise considers nursing home data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) and described in Exercise 1.2 and 2.10. You decide to examine the relationship between total patient years (LOGTPY) and the number of beds (LOGNUMBED), both in logarithmic units, using cost report year 2001 data. Summary statistics. Create basic summary statistics for each variable. Summarize the relationship through a correlation statistic and a scatter plot. Fit the basic linear model. Cite the basic summary statistics, include the coefficient of determination, the regression coefficient for LOGNUMBED and the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistic. Hypothesis testing. Test the following hypotheses at the 5% level of significance using a \\(t\\)-statistic. Also compute the corresponding \\(p\\)-value. c(i). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 0\\). c(ii). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 \\neq 1\\). c(iii). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 &gt; 1\\). c(iv). Test \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 1\\) versus \\(H_a: \\beta_1 &lt; 1\\). You are interested in the effect that a marginal change in LOGNUMBED has on the expected value of LOGTPY. d(i). Suppose that there is a marginal change in LOGNUMBED of 2. Provide a point estimate of the expected change in LOGTPY. d(ii). Provide a 95% confidence interval corresponding to the point estimate in part d(i). d(iii). Provide a 99% confidence interval corresponding to the point estimate in part d(i). At a specified number of beds estimate \\(x_{*} = 100\\), do these things: e(i). Find the predicted value of LOGTPY. e(ii). Obtain the standard error of the prediction. e(iii). Obtain a 95% prediction interval for your prediction. e(iv). Convert the point prediction in part e(i) and the prediction interval obtained in part e(iii) into total person years (through exponentiation). e(v). Obtain a prediction interval as in part e(iv), corresponding to a 90% level (in lieu of 95%). 2.21 Initial Public Offerings. As a financial analyst, you wish to convince a client of the merits of investing in firms that have just entered a stock exchange, as an IPO (initial public offering). Thus, you gather data on 116 firms that priced during the six-month time frame of January 1, 1998 through June 1, 1998. By looking at this recent historical data, you are able to compute RETURN, the firm’s one-year return (in percent). You are also interested in looking at financial characteristics of the firm that may help you understand (and predict) the return. You initially examine REVENUE, the firm’s 1997 revenues in millions of dollars. Unfortunately, this variable was not available for six firms. Thus, the statistics below are for the 110 firms that have both REVENUES and RETURNS. In addition, Table 2.9 provides information on the (natural) logarithmic revenues, denoted as LnREV, and the initial price of the stock, denoted as PRICEIPO. Table 2.9: Summary Statistics of Each Variable Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum RETURN 0.106 -0.130 0.824 -0.938 4.333 REV 134.487 39.971 261.881 0.099 1455.761 LnREV 3.686 3.688 1.698 -2.316 7.283 PRICEIPO 13.195 13.000 4.694 4.000 29.000 You hypothesize that larger firms, as measured by revenues, are more stable and thus should enjoy greater returns. You have determined that the correlation between RETURN and REVENUE is -0.0175. a(i). Calculate the least squares fit using REVENUE to predict RETURN. Determine \\(b_0\\) and \\(b_1\\). a(ii). For Hyperion Telecommunications, REVENUEs are 95.55 (millions of dollars). Calculate the fitted RETURN using the regression fit in part a(i). Table 2.11. Regression Results from a Model Fit with Logarithmic Revenues \\[ \\begin{array}{l|rrr} \\hline &amp; &amp; \\text{Standard} &amp; \\\\ \\text{Variable} &amp; \\text{Coefficient} &amp; \\text{Error} &amp; t-\\text{statistic} \\\\ \\hline \\text{INTERCEPT} &amp; 0.438 &amp; 0.186 &amp; 2.35\\\\ \\text{LnREV} &amp; -0.090 &amp; 0.046 &amp; -1.97 \\\\ \\hline s = 0.8136, &amp; R^2 = 0.03452 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] b. Logarithmic revenues and returns. b(i). Suppose instead that you use LnREVs to predict RETURN. Calculate the fitted RETURN under this regression model. Is this equal your answer in part a(ii)? b(ii) Do logarithmic revenues significantly affect returns? To this end, provide a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Use a 10% level of significance. b(iii). You conjecture that, other things equal, that firms with larger revenues will be more stable and thus enjoy a larger initial return. Thus, you wish to consider the null hypothesis of no relation between LnREV and RETURN versus the alternative hypothesis that there is a positive relation between LnREV and RETURN. To this end, provide a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Use a 10% level of significance. Determine the correlation between LnREV and RETURN. Be sure to state whether this correlation is positive, negative or zero. You are considering investing in a firm that has LnREV = 2 (so revenues are \\(e^2\\) = 7.389 millions of dollars). d(i). Using the fitted regression model, determine the least squares point prediction. d(ii). Determine the 95% prediction interval corresponding to your prediction in part d(i). The \\(R^2\\) from the fitted regression model is a disappointing 3.5%. Part of the difficulty is due to observation number 59, the Inktomi Corporation. Inktomi sales are 12th smallest of the data set, with LnREV = 1.76 (so revenues are \\(e^{1.76} = 5.79\\) millions of dollars), yet it has the highest first year return, with RETURN = 433.33. e(i). Calculate the residual for this observation. e(ii). What proportion of the unexplained variability (error sum of squares) does this observation account for? e(iii). Define the idea of a high leverage observation. e(iv). Would this observation be considered a high leverage observation? Justify your answer. 2.22 National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercise 1.7 by examining the relation between \\(y= LIFEEXP\\) and \\(x=FERTILITY\\), shown in Figure 2.12. Fit a linear regression model of \\(LIFEEXP\\) using the explanatory variable \\(x=FERTILITY\\). Figure 2.12: Plot of FERTILITY versus LIFEEXP. The US has a FERTILITY rate of 2.0. Determine the fitted life expectancy. The island nation Dominica did not report a FERTILITY rate and thus was not included in the regression. Suppose that its FERTILITY rate is 2.0. Provide a 95% prediction interval for the life expectancy in Dominica. China has a FERTILITY rate of 1.7 and a life expectancy of 72.5. Determine the residual under the model. How many multiples of \\(s\\) is this residual from zero? Suppose that your prior hypothesis is that the FERTILITY slope is -6.0 and you wish to test the null hypothesis that the slope has increased (that is, the slope is greater than -6.0). Test this hypothesis at the 5% level of significance. Also compute an approximate \\(p\\)-value. 2.11 Technical Supplement - Elements of Matrix Algebra Examples are an excellent tool for introducing technical topics such as regression. However, this chapter has also used algebra as well as basic probability and statistics to give you further insights into regression analysis. Going forward, we will be studying multivariate relationships. With many things happening concurrently in several dimensions, algebra is no longer useful for providing insights. Instead, we will need matrix algebra. This supplement provides a brief introduction to matrix algebra to allow you to study the linear regression chapters of this text. It re-introduces basic linear regression to give you a feel for things that will be coming up in subsequent chapters when we extend basic linear regression to the multivariate case. Appendix A3 defines additional matrix concepts. 2.11.1 Basic Definitions A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns (the plural of matrix is matrices). For example, consider the income and age of 3 people. \\[ \\mathbf{A}= \\begin{array}{c} Row~1 \\\\ Row~2 \\\\ Row~3 \\end{array} \\overset{ \\begin{array}{cc} ~~~Col~1~ &amp; Col~2 \\end{array} }{\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6,000 &amp; 23 \\\\ 13,000 &amp; 47 \\\\ 11,000 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) } \\] Here, column 1 represents income and column 2 represents age. Each row corresponds to an individual. For example, the first individual is 23 years old with an income of $6,000. The number of rows and columns is called the dimension of the matrix. For example, the dimension of the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) above is \\(3\\times 2\\) (read 3 “by” 2). This stands for 3 rows and 2 columns. If we were to represent the income and age of 100 people, then the dimension of the matrix would be \\(100\\times 2\\). It is convenient to represent a matrix using the notation \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\\\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Here, \\(a_{ij}\\) is the symbol for the number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In general, we work with matrices of the form \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{n1} &amp; a_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\] In this case, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(n\\times k\\). A vector is a special matrix. A row vector is a matrix containing only 1 row (\\(k=1\\)). A column vector is a matrix containing only 1 column (\\(n=1\\)). For example, \\[ \\text{column vector}\\rightarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 6 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~~\\text{row vector}\\rightarrow \\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Notice above that the row vector takes much less room on a printed page than the corresponding column vector. A basic operation that relates these two quantities is the transpose. The transpose of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is defined by interchanging the rows and columns and is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{A }^{\\prime }\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{A}^{T}\\)). For example, \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6,000 &amp; 23 \\\\ 13,000 &amp; 47 \\\\ 11,000 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime }=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 6,000 &amp; 13,000 &amp; 11,000 \\\\ 23 &amp; 47 &amp; 35 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Thus, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(n\\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime }\\) has dimensions \\(k\\times n\\). 2.11.2 Some Special Matrices 2.11.3 Basic Operations Scalar Multiplication Let \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) by a \\(n\\times k\\) matrix and let \\(c\\) be a real number. That is, a real number is a \\(1\\times 1\\) matrix and is also called a scalar. Multiplying a scalar \\(c\\) by a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is denoted by \\(c\\mathbf{A}\\) and defined by \\[ c\\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} ca_{11} &amp; ca_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{1k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ ca_{n1} &amp; ca_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\] For example, suppose that \\(c=10\\) and \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 2 \\\\ 6 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{~~~~ then ~~~~ }\\mathbf{B}=c\\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 10 &amp; 20 \\\\ 60 &amp; 80 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Note that \\(c\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{A}c\\). Addition and Subtraction of Matrices Let \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) be matrices with dimensions \\(n\\times k\\). Use \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(b_{ij}\\) to denote the numbers in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. Then, the matrix $ =+$ is defined to be the matrix with $ (a_{ij}+b_{ij})$ in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Similarly, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}\\) is defined to be the matrix with \\((a_{ij}-b_{ij})\\) in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Symbolically, we write this as the following. \\[ \\text{If }\\mathbf{A=}\\left( a_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{ and } \\mathbf{B=}\\left( b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{, then} \\] \\[ \\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B=}\\left( a_{ij}+b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}\\text{ and }\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B=}\\left( a_{ij}-b_{ij}\\right) _{ij}. \\] For example, consider \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right). \\] Then \\[ \\mathbf{A}+\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 6 &amp; 11 \\\\ 12 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} -2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -4 &amp; 0 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Basic Linear Regression Example of Addition and Subtraction. Now, recall that the basic linear regression model can be written as \\(n\\) equations: \\[ \\begin{array}{c} y_1=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\varepsilon _1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_n+\\varepsilon _n. \\end{array} \\] We can define \\[ \\mathbf{y}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\varepsilon_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\varepsilon_n \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\text{and}~~~ \\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y} =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_n \\end{array} \\right) . \\] With this notation, we can express the \\(n\\) equations more compactly as \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y}+\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\\). Matrix Multiplication In general, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(n\\times c\\) and $ $ is a matrix of dimension \\(c\\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{AB }\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(n\\times k\\) and is defined by \\[ \\mathbf{C}=\\mathbf{AB=}\\left( \\sum_{s=1}^{c}a_{is}b_{sj}\\right) _{ij}. \\] For example consider the \\(2\\times 2\\) matrices \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 5 \\\\ 4 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ 8 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] The matrix \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 2\\). To illustrate the calculation, consider the number in the first row and second column of $ $. By the rule presented above, with \\(i=1\\) and \\(j=2\\), the corresponding element of \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) is \\(\\sum_{s=1}^2a_{1s}b_{s2}=\\) \\(a_{11}b_{12}+a_{12}b_{22}=2(6)+5(1)=17\\). The other calculations are summarized as \\[ \\mathbf{AB}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2(4)+5(8) &amp; 2(6)+5(1) \\\\ 4(4)+1(8) &amp; 4(6)+1(1) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 48 &amp; 17 \\\\ 24 &amp; 25 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] As another example, suppose \\[ \\mathbf{A}=\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 \\\\ 0 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) ~~~\\mathbf{B}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Because \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 3\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) has dimension \\(3\\times 1\\), this means that the product \\(\\mathbf{AB}\\) has dimension \\(2\\times 1\\).. The calculations are summarized as \\[ \\mathbf{AB}=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 1(3)+2(5)+4(2) \\\\ 0(3)+5(5)+8(2) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 21 \\\\ 41 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] For some additional examples, we have \\[ \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; 2 \\\\ 5 &amp; 8 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\\\ a_2 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 4a_1+2a_2 \\\\ 5a_1+8a_2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] \\[ \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{array} \\right) =2^2+3^2+5^2=38~~~\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 2 \\\\ 3 \\\\ 5 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 4 &amp; 6 &amp; 10 \\\\ 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 15 \\\\ 10 &amp; 15 &amp; 25 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] In general, you see that \\(\\mathbf{AB\\neq BA}\\) in matrix multiplication, unlike multiplication of scalars (real numbers). Further, we remark that the identity matrix serves the role of “one” in matrix multiplication, in that \\(\\mathbf{AI=A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{IA=A}\\) for any matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), providing that the dimensions are compatible to allow matrix multiplication. Basic Linear Regression Example of Matrix Multiplication. Define \\[ \\mathbf{X}=\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; x_1 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\text{ and }\\boldsymbol \\beta =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{, to get } \\mathbf X \\boldsymbol \\beta =\\left( \\text{\\ } \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0+\\beta_1x_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{\\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y.}} \\] Thus, this yields the familiar matrix expression of the regression model, $ + .$ Other useful quantities include \\[ \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} y_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) =y_1^2+\\cdots +y_n^2=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i^2, \\] \\[ \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ x_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i \\end{array} \\right) \\] and \\[ \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ x_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; x_1 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_n \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i &amp; \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Note that \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\) is a symmetric matrix. Matrix Inverses In matrix algebra, there is no concept of “division.” Instead, we extend the concept of “reciprocals” of real numbers. To begin, suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a square matrix of dimension \\(k \\times k\\) and let \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) be the \\(k\\times k\\) identity matrix. If there exists a \\(k \\times k\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{AB}=\\mathbf{I=BA}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is called the inverseof \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and is written \\[ \\mathbf{B}=\\mathbf{A}^{-1}. \\] Now, not all square matrices have inverses. Further, even when an inverse exists, it may not be easy to compute by hand. One exception to this rule are diagonal matrices. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is diagonal matrix of the form \\[ \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} a_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{kk} \\end{array} \\right). \\text{ Then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccc} \\frac{1}{a_{11}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{1}{a_{kk}} \\end{array} \\right). \\] For example, \\[ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -19 \\end{array} \\right) &amp; \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{1}{2} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; -\\frac{1}{19} \\end{array} \\right) &amp; = &amp; \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ \\mathbf{A} &amp; \\mathbf{A}^{-1} &amp; = &amp; \\mathbf{I} \\end{array} . \\] In the case of a matrix of dimension \\(2\\times 2\\), the inversion procedure can be accomplished by hand easily even when the matrix is not diagonal. In the \\(2\\times 2\\) case, we suppose that if \\[ \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b \\\\ c &amp; d \\end{array} \\right), \\text{ then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} d &amp; -b \\\\ -c &amp; a \\end{array} \\right) \\text{.} \\] Thus, for example, if \\[ \\mathbf{A=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{ then }\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{2(4)-2(3)} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 4 &amp; -2 \\\\ -3 &amp; 2 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -3/2 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\text{.} \\] As a check, we have \\[ \\mathbf{A\\mathbf{A}^{-1}=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; 2 \\\\ 3 &amp; 4 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2 &amp; -1 \\\\ -3/2 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 2(2)-2(3/2) &amp; 2(-1)+2(1) \\\\ 3(2)-4(3/2) &amp; 3(-1)+4(1) \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{I}\\text{.} \\] Basic Linear Regression Example of Matrix Inverses.

Thus, \\[\\begin{equation} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{1}{ \\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 &amp; -\\overline{x} \\\\ -\\overline{x} &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\tag{2.9} \\end{equation}\\] Section 3.1 will discuss the relation \\(\\mathbf{b}=\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\). To illustrate the calculation, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathbf{b} &amp;=&amp;\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{X} ^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y=}\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} n^{-1}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2 &amp; -\\overline{x} \\\\ -\\overline{x} &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}y_i \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i \\end{array} \\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\overline{y}x_i^2-\\overline{x} x_iy_i\\right) \\\\ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i-n\\overline{x}\\overline{y} \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\end{array} \\right) . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] From this expression, we may see \\[ b_1=\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i-n\\overline{x}\\overline{y}}{ \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2} \\] and \\[ b_0=\\frac{\\overline{y}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-\\overline{x} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_iy_i}{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x} ^2}=\\frac{\\overline{y}\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x} ^2\\right) -\\overline{x}\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i y_i - n\\overline{x} \\overline{y}\\right) }{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2-n\\overline{x}^2}= \\overline{y}-b_1\\overline{x}. \\] These are the usual expressions for the slope \\(b_1\\) (Exercise 2A.8) and intercept \\(b_0\\). 2.11.4 Random Matrices Expectations. Consider a matrix of random variables \\[ \\mathbf{U=}\\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} u_{11} &amp; u_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{1c} \\\\ u_{21} &amp; u_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{2c} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ u_{n1} &amp; u_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; u_{nc} \\end{array} \\right). \\] When we write the expectation of a matrix, this is short-hand for the matrix of expectations. Specifically, suppose that the joint probability function of \\({u_{11}, u_{12}, ..., u_{1c}, ..., u_{n1}, ..., u_{nc}}\\) is available to define the expectation operator. Then we define \\[ \\mathrm{E} ~ \\mathbf{U} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{E }u_{11} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{1c} \\\\ \\mathrm{E }u_{21} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{2c} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E }u_{n1} &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{n2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{E }u_{nc} \\end{array} \\right). \\] As an important special case, consider the joint probability function for the random variables \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) and the corresponding expectations operator. Then \\[ \\mathrm{E}~ \\mathbf{y=} \\mathrm{E } \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{E }y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E }y_n \\end{array} \\right). \\] By the linearity of expectations, for a non-random matrix A and vector , we have E ( + ) = E . Variances. We can also work with second moments of random vectors. The variance of a vector of random variables is called the variance-covariance matrix. It is defined by \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var} ~ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathrm{E} ( (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathrm{E} \\mathbf{y})(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathrm{E} \\mathbf{y})^{\\prime} ). \\tag{2.10} \\end{equation}\\] That is, we can express \\[ \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y=} \\mathrm{E } \\left( \\left( \\begin{array}{c} y_1 -\\mathrm{E } y_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n -\\mathrm{E } y_n \\end{array}\\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} y_1 - \\mathrm{E } y_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; y_n - \\mathrm{E } y_n \\end{array}\\right) \\right) \\] \\[ = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var}~y_1 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1, y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp;\\mathrm{Cov}(y_1, y_n) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2, y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2, y_n) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n, y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n, y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_n \\\\ \\end{array}\\right), \\] because \\(\\mathrm{E} ( (y_i - \\mathrm{E} y_i)(y_j - \\mathrm{E} y_j) ) = \\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j)\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_i) = \\mathrm{Var}~y_i\\). In the case that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are mutually uncorrelated, we have that \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j)=0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\) and thus \\[ \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y=} \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var}~y_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots\\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var}~y_n \\\\ \\end{array}\\right). \\] Further, if the variances are identical so that \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma ^2\\), then we can write \\(\\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} = \\sigma ^2 \\mathbf{I}\\), where I is the \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix. For example, if \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are i.i.d., then \\(\\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} = \\sigma ^2 \\mathbf{I}\\). From equation (2.10), it can be shown that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{Ay +B} \\right) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{Ay} \\right) = \\mathbf{A} \\left( \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}. \\tag{2.11} \\end{equation}\\] For example, if \\(\\mathbf{A} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n)= \\mathbf{a}^{\\prime}\\) and B = 0, then equation (2.11) reduces to \\[ \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i \\right) = \\mathrm{Var} \\left( \\mathbf{a^{\\prime} y} \\right) = \\mathbf{a^{\\prime}} \\left( \\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n) \\left( \\mathrm{Var} ~\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\left(\\begin{array}{c} a_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ a_n \\end{array}\\right) \\] \\[ = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\mathrm{Var} ~y_i ~+~2 \\sum_{i=2}^n \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} a_i a_j \\mathrm{Cov}(y_i, y_j). \\] Definition - Multivariate Normal Distribution. A vector of random variables \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\left(y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\right)^{\\prime}\\) is said to be multivariate normal if all linear combinations of the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i\\) are normally distributed. In this case, we write \\(\\mathbf{y} \\sim N (\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma} )\\), where \\(\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu} = \\mathrm{E}~ \\mathbf{y}\\) is the expected value of y and \\(\\mathbf{\\Sigma}= \\mathrm{Var}~\\mathbf{y}\\) is the variance-covariance matrix of y. From the definition, we have that \\(\\mathbf{y}\\sim N (\\mathbf{\\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{\\Sigma} )\\) implies that \\(\\mathbf{a^{\\prime}y}\\sim N (\\mathbf{a^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\mu}, \\mathbf{a^{\\prime}\\Sigma a})\\). Thus, if \\(y_i\\) are i.i.d., then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i\\) is distributed normally with mean \\(\\mu \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\) and variance \\(\\sigma ^2 \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i ^2\\).

This chapter introduces linear regression in the case of several explanatory variables, known as multiple linear regression. Many basic linear regression concepts extend directly, including goodness of fit measures such as \\(R^2\\) and inference using \\(t\\)-statistics. Multiple linear regression models provide a framework for summarizing highly complex, multivariate data. Because this framework requires only linearity in the parameters, we are able to fit models that are nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables, thus providing a wide scope of potential applications. 3.1 Method of Least Squares 3.1.1 Least Squares Method Chapter 2 dealt with the problem of a response depending on a single explanatory variable. We now extend the focus of that chapter and study how a response may depend on several explanatory variables. Example: Term Life Insurance. Like all firms, life insurance companies continually seek new ways to deliver products to the market. Those involved in product development wish to know “who buys insurance and how much do they buy?” In economics, this is known as the demand side of a market for products. Analysts can readily get information on characteristics of current customers through company databases. Potential customers, those that do not have insurance with the company, are often the main focus for expanding market share. In this example, we examine the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally representative sample that contains extensive information on assets, liabilities, income, and demographic characteristics of those sampled (potential U.S. customers). We study a random sample of 500 households with positive incomes that were interviewed in the 2004 survey. We initially consider the subset of \\(n=275\\) families that purchased term life insurance. We wish to address the second portion of the demand question and determine family characteristics that influence the amount of insurance purchased. Chapter 11 will consider the first portion, whether or not a household purchases insurance, through models where the response is a binary random variable. For term life insurance, the quantity of insurance is measured by the policy FACE, the amount that the company will pay in the event of the death of the named insured. Characteristics that will turn out to be important include annual INCOME, the number of years of EDUCATION of the survey respondent, and the number of household members, NUMHH. 3.1.2 General Case with k Explanatory Variables In general, we will consider data sets where there are \\(k\\) explanatory variables and one response variable in a sample of size \\(n\\). That is, the data consist of: \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned} x_{11},x_{12},\\ldots,x_{1k},y_1 \\\\ x_{21},x_{22},\\ldots,x_{2k},y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ x_{n1},x_{n2},\\ldots,x_{nk},y_n \\end{aligned} \\right\\}. \\] The \\(i\\)th observation corresponds to the \\(i\\)th row, consisting of \\((x_{i1},x_{i2},\\ldots,x_{ik},y_i)\\). For this general case, we take \\(k+1\\) measurements on each entity. For the insurance demand example, \\(k=3\\) and the data consists of \\((x_{11},x_{12},x_{13}, y_1), \\ldots , (x_{275,1},x_{275,2},x_{275,3},y_{275})\\). That is, we use four measurements from each of the \\(n=275\\) households. Summarizing the Data We begin the data analysis by examining each variable in isolation from the others. Table 3.1 provides basic summary statistics of the four variables. For FACE and INCOME, we see that the mean is much greater than the median, suggesting that the distribution is skewed to the right. Histograms (not reported here) show that this is the case. It will turn out to be useful to also consider their logarithmic transforms, LNFACE and LNINCOME, respectively, which are also reported in Table 3.1. Table 3.1: Term Life Summary Statistics Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum FACE 747,581 150,000 1,674,362 800 14,000,000 INCOME 208,975 65,000 824,010 260 10,000,000 EDUCATION 14.524 16 2.549 2 17 NUMHH 2.96 3 1.493 1 9 LNFACE 11.99 11.918 1.871 6.685 16.455 LNINCOME 11.149 11.082 1.295 5.561 16.118 The next step is to measure the relationship between each \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), beginning with the scatter plots in Figure 3.1. The left-hand panel is a plot of FACE versus INCOME; in this panel, we see a large clustering in the lower left-hand corner corresponding to households that have both small incomes and face amounts of insurance. Both variables have skewed distributions and their joint effect is highly nonlinear. The right-hand panel presents the same variables but using logarithmic transforms. Here, we see a relationship that can be more readily approximated with a line. Figure 3.1: Income versus Face Amount of Term Life Insurance. The left-panel is a plot of face versus income, showing a highly nonlinear pattern. In the right-hand panel, face versus income is in natural logarithmic units, suggesting a linear (although variable) pattern.

It is difficult to produce a graph of observations in three or more dimensions on a two-dimensional platform, such as a piece of paper, that is not confusing, misleading, or both. To summarize graphically multivariate data in regression applications, consider using a scatterplot matrix such as in Figure 3.2. Each square of this figure represents a simple plot of one variable versus another. For each square, the row variable gives the units of the vertical axis and the column variable gives the units of the horizontal axis. The matrix is sometimes called a half scatterplot matrix because only the lower left-hand elements are presented. Figure 3.2: Scatterplot matrix of four variables. Each square is a scatter plot. The scatterplot matrix can be numerically summarized using a correlation matrix. Each correlation in Table 3.2 corresponds to a square of the scatterplot matrix in Figure 3.2. Analysts often present tables of correlations because they are easy to interpret. However, remember that a correlation coefficient merely measures the extent of linear relationships. Thus, a table of correlations provides a sense of linear relationships but may miss a nonlinear relationship that can be revealed in a scatterplot matrix. Table 3.2: Term Life Correlations NUMHH EDUCATION LNINCOME EDUCATION -0.064 LNINCOME 0.179 0.343 LNFACE 0.288 0.383 0.482 The scatterplot matrix and corresponding correlation matrix are useful devices for summarizing multivariate data. They are easy to produce and to interpret. Still, each device captures only relationships between pairs of variables and cannot quantify relationships among several variables.

It seems reasonable to investigate the joint effect of these variables on a response. The geometric concept of a plane is used to explore the linear relationship between a response and several explanatory variables. Recall that a plane extends the concept of a line to more than two dimensions. A plane may be defined through an algebraic equation such as \\[ y = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + \\ldots + b_k x_k. \\] This equation defines a plane in \\(k+1\\) dimensions. Figure 3.3 shows a plane in three dimensions. For this figure, there is one response variable, LNFACE, and two explanatory variables, EDUCATION and LNINCOME (NUMHH is held fixed). It is difficult to graph more than three dimensions in a meaningful way. Figure 3.3: An example of a three-dimensional plane We need a way to determine a plane based on the data. The difficulty is that in most regression analysis applications, the number of observations, \\(n\\), far exceeds the number of observations required to fit a plane, \\(k+1\\). Thus, it is generally not possible to find a single plane that passes through all \\(n\\) observations. As in Chapter 2, we use the method of least squares to determine a plane from the data. The method of least squares is based on determining the values of \\(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast}\\) that minimize the quantity \\[\\begin{equation} SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast})=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_{i1}+\\ldots+b_k^{\\ast}x_{ik}\\right) \\right) ^2. \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] We drop the asterisk, or star, notation and use \\(b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_k\\) to denote the best values, known as the least squares estimates. With the least squares estimates, define the least squares, or fitted, regression plane as \\[ \\widehat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x_1 + \\ldots + b_k x_k. \\] The least squares estimates are determined by minimizing \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast},b_1^{\\ast},\\ldots,b_k^{\\ast})\\). It is difficult to write down the resulting least squares estimators using a simple formula unless one resorts to matrix notation. Because of their importance in applied statistical models, an explicit formula for the estimators is provided below. However, these formulas have been programmed into a wide variety of statistical and spreadsheet software packages. The availability of these packages allows data analysts to concentrate on the ideas of the estimation procedure instead of focusing on the details of the calculation procedures. As an example, a regression plane was fit to the Term Life data where three explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\) for EDUCATION, \\(x_2\\) for NUMHH, and \\(x_3\\) for LNINCOME, were used. The resulting fitted regression plane is \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{y} = 2.584 + 0.206 x_1 + 0.306 x_2 + 0.494 x_3. \\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] Matrix Notation Assume that the data are of the form \\((x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}, y_i)\\), where \\(i = 1, \\ldots, n\\). Here, the variable \\(x_{i0}\\) is associated with the “intercept” term. In most applications, we assume that \\(x_{i0}\\) is identically equal to 1 and thus need not be explicitly represented. However, there are important applications where this is not the case, and thus, to express the model in general notation, it is included here. The data are represented in matrix notation using: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_n \\end{pmatrix} ~~\\text{and}~~ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{10} &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1k} \\\\ x_{20} &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ x_{n0} &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{nk} \\end{pmatrix}. \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the \\(n \\times 1\\) vector of responses and \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is the \\(n \\times (k+1)\\) matrix of explanatory variables. We use the matrix algebra convention that lower and upper case bold letters represent vectors and matrices, respectively. (If you need to brush up on matrices, review Section 2.11.) Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. Recall that \\(y\\) represents the logarithmic face, \\(x_1\\) for years of education, \\(x_2\\) for the number of household members, and \\(x_3\\) for logarithmic income. Thus, there are \\(k = 3\\) explanatory variables and \\(n = 275\\) households. The vector of responses and the matrix of explanatory variables are: \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\\\ y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{275} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 9.904 \\\\ 11.775 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 9.210 \\end{pmatrix} ~~\\text{and}~~ \\\\ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; x_{12} &amp; x_{13} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; x_{22} &amp; x_{23} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{275,1} &amp; x_{275,2} &amp; x_{275,3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 16 &amp; 3 &amp; 10.669 \\\\ 1 &amp; 9 &amp; 3 &amp; 9.393 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; 12 &amp; 1 &amp; 10.545 \\end{pmatrix}. \\] For example, for the first observation in the data set, the dependent variable is \\(y_1 = 9.904\\) (corresponding to \\(\\exp(9.904) = \\$20,000\\)), for a survey respondent with 16 years of education living in a household with 3 people and a logarithmic income of 10.669 (\\(\\exp(10.669) = \\$43,000\\)). Under the least squares estimation principle, our goal is to choose the coefficients \\(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}\\) to minimize the sum of squares function \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})\\). Using calculus, we return to the equation for the sum of squares, take partial derivatives with respect to each coefficient, and set these quantities equal to zero: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial b_j^{\\ast}}SS(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}) &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( -2x_{ij}\\right) \\left( y_i-\\left( b_0^{\\ast}+b_1^{\\ast}x_{i1}+\\ldots+b_k^{\\ast}x_{ik}\\right) \\right) \\\\ &amp;= 0, ~~~ \\text{for} ~ j=0,1,\\ldots,k. \\end{array} \\] This is a system of \\(k+1\\) equations and \\(k+1\\) unknowns that can be readily solved using matrix notation, as follows. We may express the vector of parameters to be minimized as \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}=(b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})^{\\prime}\\). Using this, the sum of squares can be written as \\(SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = (\\mathbf{y-Xb}^{\\ast})^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{y-Xb}^{\\ast})\\). Thus, in matrix form, the solution to the minimization problem can be expressed as \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}} SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{0}\\). This solution satisfies the normal equations: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}Xb} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}. \\tag{3.3} \\end{equation}\\] Here, the asterisk notation (*) has been dropped to denote the fact that \\(\\mathbf{b} = (b_0, b_1, \\ldots, b_k)^{\\prime}\\) represents the best vector of values in the sense of minimizing \\(SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast})\\) over all choices of \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\). The least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) need not be unique. However, assuming that the explanatory variables are not linear combinations of one another, we have that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) is invertible. In this case, we can write the unique solution as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{3.4} \\end{equation}\\] To illustrate, for the Term Life example, equation (3.4) yields: \\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_0 \\\\ b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.584 \\\\ 0.206 \\\\ 0.306 \\\\ 0.494 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}. \\] 3.2 Linear Regression Model and Properties of Estimators In the previous section, we learned how to use the method of least squares to fit a regression plane with a data set. This section describes the assumptions underpinning the regression model and some of the resulting properties of the regression coefficient estimators. With the model and the fitted data, we will be able to draw inferences about the sample data set to a larger population. Moreover, we will later use these regression model assumptions to help us improve the model specification in Chapter 5. 3.2.1 Regression Function Most of the assumptions of the multiple linear regression model will carry over directly from the basic linear regression model assumptions introduced in Section 2.2. The primary difference is that we now summarize the relationship between the response and the explanatory variables through the regression function: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 x_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k, \\tag{3.5} \\end{equation}\\] which is linear in the parameters \\(\\beta_0,\\ldots,\\beta_k\\). Henceforth, we will use \\(x_0 = 1\\) for the variable associated with the parameter \\(\\beta_0\\); this is the default in most statistical packages, and most applications of regression include the intercept term \\(\\beta_0\\). The intercept is the expected value of \\(y\\) when all of the explanatory variables are equal to zero. Although rarely of interest, the term \\(\\beta_0\\) serves to set the height of the fitted regression plane. In contrast, the other betas are typically important parameters from a regression study. To help interpret them, we initially assume that \\(x_j\\) varies continuously and is not related to the other explanatory variables. Then, we can interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) as the expected change in \\(y\\) per unit change in \\(x_j\\) assuming all other explanatory variables are held fixed. That is, from calculus, you will recognize that \\(\\beta_j\\) can be interpreted as a partial derivative. Specifically, using the equation above, we have that \\[ \\beta_j = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_j}\\mathrm{E}~y. \\] 3.2.2 Regression Coefficient Interpretation Let us examine the regression coefficient estimates from the Term Life Insurance example and focus initially on the sign of the coefficients. For example, from equation (3.4), the coefficient associated with NUMHH is \\(b_2 = 0.306 &gt; 0\\). If we consider two households that have the same income and the same level of education, then the larger household (in terms of NUMHH) is expected to demand more term life insurance under the regression model. This is a sensible interpretation; larger households have more dependents for which term life insurance can provide needed financial assets in the event of the untimely death of a breadwinner. The positive coefficient associated with income (\\(b_3 = 0.494\\)) is also plausible; households with larger incomes have more disposable dollars to purchase insurance. The positive sign associated with EDUCATION (\\(b_1 = 0.206)\\) is also reasonable; more education suggests that respondents are more aware of their insurance needs, other things being equal. You will also need to interpret the amount of the regression coefficient. Consider first the EDUCATION coefficient. Using equation (3.4), fitted values of \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) were calculated by allowing EDUCATION to vary and keeping NUMHH and LNINCOME fixed at the sample averages. The results are: Effects of Small Changes in Education EDUCATION 14 14.1 14.2 14.3 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{LNFACE}}\\) 11.883 11.904 11.924 11.945 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) 144,803 147,817 150,893 154,034 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change 2.081 2.081 2.081 As EDUCATION increases, \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) increases. Further, the amount of \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}}\\) increase is a constant 0.0206. This comes directly from equation (3.4); as EDUCATION increases by 0.1 years, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 0.0206 logarithmic dollars, holding NUMHH and LNINCOME fixed. This interpretation is correct, but most product development directors are not overly fond of logarithmic dollars. To return to dollars, fitted face values can be calculated through exponentiation as \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{FACE}} = \\exp(\\widehat{\\mathrm{LNFACE}})\\). Moreover, the percentage change can be computed; for example, \\(100 \\times (147,817/144,803 - 1) \\approx 2.08\\%\\). This provides another interpretation of the regression coefficient; as EDUCATION increases by 0.1 years, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 2.08%. This is a simple consequence of calculus using \\(\\partial \\ln y / \\partial x = \\left(\\partial y / \\partial x \\right) / y\\); that is, a small change in the logarithmic value of \\(y\\) equals a small change in \\(y\\) as a proportion of \\(y\\). It is because of this calculus result that we use natural logs instead of common logs in regression analysis. Because this table uses a discrete change in EDUCATION, the 2.08% differs slightly from the continuous result \\(0.206 \\times (\\mathrm{change~in~EDUCATION}) = 2.06\\%\\). However, this proximity is usually regarded as suitable for interpretation purposes. Continuing this logic, consider small changes in logarithmic income. Effects of Small Changes in Logarithmic Income LNINCOME 11 11.1 11.2 11.3 INCOME 59,874 66,171 73,130 80,822 INCOME % Change 10.52 10.52 10.52 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{LNFACE}}\\) 11.957 12.006 12.055 12.105 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) 155,831 163,722 172,013 180,724 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change 5.06 5.06 5.06 \\(\\widehat{\\mathit{FACE}}\\) % Change / INCOME % Change 0.482 0.482 0.482 We can use the same logic to interpret the LNINCOME coefficient in equation (3.4). As logarithmic income increases by 0.1 units, we expect the demand for insurance to increase by 5.06%. This takes care of logarithmic units in the \\(y\\) but not the \\(x\\). We can use the same logic to say that as logarithmic income increases by 0.1 units, INCOME increases by 10.52%. Thus, a 10.52% change in INCOME corresponds to a 5.06% change in FACE. Summarizing, we say that, holding NUMHH and EDUCATION fixed, we expect that a 1% increase in INCOME is associated with a 0.482% increase in \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{FACE}}\\) (as before, this is close to the parameter estimate \\(b_3 = 0.494\\)). The coefficient associated with income is known as an elasticity in economics. In economics, elasticity is the ratio of the percent change in one variable to the percent change in another variable. Mathematically, we summarize this as: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\ln y}{\\partial \\ln x} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial y}{y}\\right)/\\left(\\frac{\\partial x}{x}\\right). \\] 3.2.3 Model Assumptions As in Section 2.2 for a single explanatory variable, there are two sets of assumptions that one can use for multiple linear regression. They are equivalent sets, each having comparative advantages as we proceed in our study of regression. The “observables” representation focuses on variables of interest \\((x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}, y_i)\\). The “error representation” provides a springboard for motivating our goodness of fit measures and study of residual analysis. However, the latter set of assumptions focuses on the additive errors case and obscures the sampling basis of the model. \\[ \\textbf{Multiple Linear Regression Model Sampling Assumptions} \\\\ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Observables Representation} &amp; \\text{Error Representation} \\\\ \\hline F1.~ \\mathrm{E}~y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_k x_{ik}. &amp; E1.~ y_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x_{i1}+\\ldots+\\beta_k x_{ik}+\\varepsilon_i. \\\\ F2.~ \\{x_{i1},\\ldots ,x_{ik}\\} &amp; E2.~ \\{x_{i1},\\ldots ,x_{ik}\\} \\\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{are non-stochastic variables.} &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{are non-stochastic variables.} \\\\ F3.~ \\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\sigma^2. &amp; E3.~ \\mathrm{E}~\\varepsilon_i=0 \\text{ and } \\mathrm{Var}~\\varepsilon_i=\\sigma^2. \\\\ F4.~ \\{y_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables.} &amp; E4.~ \\{\\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are independent random variables.} \\\\ F5.~ \\{y_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed.} &amp; E5.~ \\{\\varepsilon_i\\} \\text{ are normally distributed.} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] To further motivate Assumptions F2 and F4, we will usually assume that our data have been realized as the result of a stratified sampling scheme, where each unique value of \\(\\{x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\}\\) is treated as a stratum. That is, for each value of \\(\\{x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik}\\}\\), we draw a random sample of responses from a population. Thus, responses within each stratum are independent from one another, as are responses from different strata. Chapter 6 will discuss this sampling basis in further detail. 3.2.4 Properties of Regression Coefficient Estimators Section 3.1 described the least squares method for estimating regression coefficients. With the regression model assumptions, we can establish some basic properties of these estimators. To do this, from Section 2.11.4 we have that the expectation of a vector is the vector of expectations, so that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = \\left( \\begin{array}{l} \\mathrm{E}~y_1 \\\\ \\mathrm{E}~y_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{E}~y_n \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Further, basic matrix multiplication shows that \\[ \\small{ \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; x_{11} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{1k} \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{21} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 1 &amp; x_{n1} &amp; \\cdots &amp; x_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{11} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{1k} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{21} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{n1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{nk} \\end{array} \\right) . } \\] Because the \\(i\\)th row of assumption F1 is \\(\\mathrm{E}~y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik}\\), we may re-write this assumption in matrix formulation as \\(\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\). We are now in a position to state the first important property of least squares regression estimators. Property 1. Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is an unbiased estimator of the parameter vector \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). To establish Property 1, we have that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{b} = \\mathrm{E}~\\left((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\right) = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) = \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\] using matrix multiplication rules. This chapter assumes that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) is invertible. One can also show that the least squares estimator need only be a solution of the normal equations for unbiasedness (not requiring that \\(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\) be invertible, see Section 4.7.3). Thus, \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). In particular, \\(\\mathrm{E}~b_j = \\beta_j\\) for \\(j = 0,1,\\ldots,k\\). Because independence implies zero covariance, from Assumption F4 we have that \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(y_i,y_j) = 0\\) for \\(i \\neq j\\). From this, Assumption F3 and the definition of the variance of a vector, we have that \\[ \\small{ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{y} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\mathrm{Var~}y_1 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1,y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_1,y_n) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2,y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}y_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_2,y_n) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n,y_1) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(y_n,y_2) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}y_n \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} \\sigma^2 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma^2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\sigma^2 \\end{array} \\right) = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}, } \\] where \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) is an \\(n \\times n\\) identity matrix. We are now in a position to state the second important property of least squares regression estimators. Property 2. Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) has variance \\(\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b} = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). To establish Property 2, we have that \\[ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b} = \\mathrm{Var}\\left((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\right) = \\left[ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\right] \\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{y}\\right) \\left[\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\right] \\\\ = \\left[ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\right] \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\left[\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\right] = \\sigma^2(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}, \\] as required. This important property will allow us to measure the precision of the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) when we discuss statistical inference. Specifically, by the definition of the variance of a vector (see Section 2.11.4), \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}= \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathrm{Var~}b_0 &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_1) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_k) \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(b_1,b_0) &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}b_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_1,b_k) \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathrm{Cov}(b_k,b_0) &amp; \\mathrm{Cov}(b_k,b_1) &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathrm{Var~}b_k \\end{pmatrix} = \\sigma^2 (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}. \\tag{3.6} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, for example, \\(\\mathrm{Var~}b_j\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the \\((j+1)\\)st diagonal entry of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). As another example, \\(\\mathrm{Cov}(b_0,b_j)\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the element in the first row and \\((j+1)\\)st column of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\). Although alternative methods are available that are preferable for specific applications, the least squares estimators have proven to be effective for many routine data analyses. One desirable characteristic of least squares regression estimators is summarized in the following well-known result. Gauss-Markov Theorem: Consider the regression model and let Assumptions F1-F4 hold. Then, within the class of estimators that are linear functions of the responses, the least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is the minimum variance unbiased estimator of the parameter vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). The Gauss-Markov theorem states that the least squares estimator is the most precise in the sense that it has the smallest variance. We have already seen in Property 1 that the least squares estimators are unbiased. The Gauss-Markov theorem states that the least squares estimator is the most precise in the sense that it has the smallest variance. (In a matrix context, “minimum variance” means that if \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\) is any other estimator, then the difference of the variance matrices, \\(\\mathrm{Var~} \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast} - \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}\\), is nonnegative definite.) An additional important property concerns the distribution of the least squares regression estimators. Property 3: Consider a regression model and let Assumptions F1-F5 hold. Then, the least squares estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) defined in equation (3.4) is normally distributed. To establish Property 3, we define the weight vectors, \\(\\mathbf{w}_i = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}(1, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\). With this notation, we note that \\[ \\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{w}_i y_i, \\] so that \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is a linear combination of responses. With Assumption F5, the responses are normally distributed. Because linear combinations of normally distributed random variables are normally distributed, we have the conclusion of Property 3. This result underpins much of the statistical inference that will be presented in Sections 3.4 and 4.2. 3.3 Estimation and Goodness of Fit Residual Standard Deviation Additional properties of the regression coefficient estimators will be discussed when we focus on statistical inference. We now continue our estimation discussion by providing an estimator of the other parameter in the linear regression model, \\(\\sigma^2\\). Our estimator for \\(\\sigma^2\\) can be developed using the principle of replacing theoretical expectations by sample averages. Examining \\(\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{E}\\left( y-\\mathrm{E~}y\\right)^2\\), replacing the outer expectation by a sample average suggests using the estimator \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\\mathrm{E~}y_i)^2\\). Because we do not observe \\(\\mathrm{E}~y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik}\\), we use in its place the corresponding observed quantity \\(b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_k x_{ik} = \\widehat{y}_i\\). This leads to the following. Definition. An estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\), the mean square error (MSE), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-(k+1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)^2. \\tag{3.7} \\end{equation}\\] The positive square root, \\(s = \\sqrt{s^2}\\), is called the residual standard deviation. This expression generalizes the definition in equation (2.3), which is valid for \\(k=1\\). It turns out, by using \\(n-(k+1)\\) instead of \\(n\\) in the denominator of equation (3.7), that \\(s^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\). Essentially, by using \\(\\widehat{y}_i\\) instead of \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i\\) in the definition, we have introduced some small dependencies among the deviations from the responses \\(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\), thus reducing the overall variability. To compensate for this lower variability, we also reduce the denominator in the definition of \\(s^2\\). To provide further intuition on the choice of \\(n-(k+1)\\) in the definition of \\(s^2\\), we introduced the concept of residuals in the context of multiple linear regression. From Assumption E1, recall that the random errors can be expressed as \\(\\varepsilon_i = y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{ik})\\). Because the parameters \\(\\beta_0, \\ldots, \\beta_k\\) are not observed, the errors themselves are not observed. Instead, we examine the “estimated errors,” or residuals, defined by \\(e_i = y_i - \\widehat{y}_i\\). Unlike errors, there exist certain dependencies among the residuals. One dependency is due to the algebraic fact that the average residual is zero. Further, there must be at least \\(k+2\\) observations for there to be variation in the fit of the plane. If we have only \\(k+1\\) observations, we could fit a plane to the data perfectly, resulting in no variation in the fit. For example, if \\(k=1\\), because two observations determine a line, then at least three observations are required to observe any deviation from the line. Because of these dependencies, we have only \\(n-(k+1)\\) free, or unrestricted, residuals to estimate the variability about the regression plane. The positive square root of \\(s^2\\) is our estimator of \\(\\sigma\\). Using residuals, it can be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-(k+1)}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}. \\tag{3.8} \\end{equation}\\] Because it is based on residuals, we refer to \\(s\\) as the residual standard deviation. The quantity \\(s\\) is a measure of our “typical error.” For this reason, \\(s\\) is also called the standard error of the estimate. The Coefficient of Determination: \\(R^2\\) To summarize the goodness of fit of the model, as in Chapter 2 we partition the variability into pieces that are “explained” and “unexplained” by the regression fit. Algebraically, the calculations for regression using many variables are similar to the case of using only one variable. Unfortunately, when dealing with many variables, we do lose the easy graphical interpretation such as in Figure 2.4. Begin with the total sum of squared deviations, \\(Total~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2\\), as our measure of the total variation in the data set. As in equation (2.1), we may then interpret the equation \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\underbrace{y_i - \\overline{y}} &amp; = &amp; \\underbrace{y_i - \\widehat{y}_i} &amp; + &amp; \\underbrace{\\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y}} \\\\ \\text{total} &amp; = &amp; \\text{unexplained} &amp; + &amp; \\text{explained} \\\\ \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} &amp; &amp; \\text{deviation} \\end{array} } \\] as the “deviation without knowledge of the explanatory variables equals the deviation not explained by the explanatory variables plus deviation explained by the explanatory variables.” Squaring each side and summing over all observations yields \\[ Total~SS = Error~SS + Regression~SS \\] where \\(Error~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)^2\\) and \\(Regression~SS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( \\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2\\). As in Section 2.3 for the one explanatory variable case, the sum of the cross-product terms turns out to be zero. A statistic that summarizes this relationship is the coefficient of determination, \\[ R^2 = \\frac{Regression~SS}{Total~SS}. \\] We interpret \\(R^2\\) to be the proportion of variability explained by the regression function. If the model is a desirable one for the data, one would expect a strong relationship between the observed responses and those “expected” under the model, the fitted values. An interesting algebraic fact is the following. If one squares the correlation coefficient between the responses and the fitted values, we get the coefficient of determination, that is, \\[ R^2 = \\left[ r \\left(y, \\widehat{y} \\right) \\right]^2. \\] As a result, \\(R\\), the positive square root of \\(R^2\\), is called the multiple correlation coefficient. It can be interpreted as the correlation between the response and the best linear combination of the explanatory variables, the fitted values. (This relationship is developed using matrix algebra in the technical supplement Section 5.10.1.) The variability decomposition is also summarized using the analysis of variance, or ANOVA, table, as follows. \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|lcl} \\hline \\text{Source} &amp; \\text{Sum of Squares} &amp; df &amp; \\text{Mean Square} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Regression} &amp; Regression~SS &amp; k &amp; Regression~MS \\\\ \\text{Error} &amp; Error~SS &amp; n - (k + 1) &amp; MSE \\\\ \\text{Total} &amp; Total~SS &amp; n - 1 &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] The mean square column figures are defined to be the sum of squares figures divided by their respective degrees of freedom. The error degrees of freedom denotes the number of unrestricted residuals. It is this number that we use in our definition of the “average,” or mean, square error. That is, we define \\[ MSE = Error~MS = \\frac{Error~SS}{n - (k + 1)} = s^2. \\] Similarly, the regression degrees of freedom is the number of explanatory variables. This yields \\[ Regression~MS = \\frac{Regression~SS}{k}. \\] When discussing the coefficient of determination, it can be established that whenever an explanatory variable is added to the model, \\(R^2\\) never decreases. This is true whether or not the additional variable is useful. We would like a measure of fit that decreases when useless variables are entered into the model as explanatory variables. To circumvent this anomaly, a widely used statistic is the coefficient of determination adjusted for degrees of freedom, defined by \\[\\begin{equation} R_{a}^2 = 1 - \\frac{(Error~SS) / [n - (k + 1)]}{(Total~SS) / (n - 1)} = 1 - \\frac{s^2}{s_{y}^2}. \\tag{3.9} \\end{equation}\\] To interpret this statistic, note that \\(s_y^2\\) does not depend on the model nor the model variables. Thus, \\(s^2\\) and \\(R_a^2\\) are equivalent measures of model fit. As the model fit improves, then \\(R_{a}^2\\) becomes larger and \\(s^2\\) becomes smaller, and vice versa. Put another way, choosing a model with the smallest \\(s^2\\) is equivalent to choosing a model with the largest \\(R_a^2\\). Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. To illustrate, Table 3.3 displays the summary statistics for the regression of LNFACE on EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME. From the degrees of freedom column, we remind ourselves that there are three explanatory variables and 275 observations. As measures of model fit, the coefficient of determination is \\(R^2 = 34.3\\%\\) (=\\(328.47 / 958.90\\)) and the residual standard deviation is \\(s = 1.525\\) (=\\(\\sqrt{2.326}\\)). If we were to attempt to estimate the logarithmic face amount without knowledge of the explanatory variables EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME, then the size of the typical error would be \\(s_y = 1.871\\) (=\\(\\sqrt{958.90 / 274}\\)). Thus, by taking advantage of our knowledge of the explanatory variables, we have been able to reduce the size of the typical error. The measure of model fit that compares these two estimates of variability is the adjusted coefficient of determination, \\(R_a^2 = 1 - 2.326 / 1.871^2 = 33.6\\%\\). Table 3.3: Term Life ANOVA Table Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square Regression 328.47 3 109.49 Error 630.43 271 2.326 Total 958.9 274 Example: Why do Females Live Longer than Males? In an article with this title, Lemaire (2002) examined what he called the “female advantage,” the difference in life expectancy between females and males. Life expectancies are of interest because they are widely used measures of a nation’s health. Lemaire examined data from \\(n = 169\\) countries and found that the average female advantage was 4.51 years worldwide. He sought to explain this difference based on 45 behavioral measures, variables that capture a nation’s degree of economic modernization, social/cultural/religious mores, geographic position, and quality of health care available. After a detailed analysis, Lemaire reports coefficients from a regression model that appear in Table 3.4. This regression model explains \\(R^2 = 61\\%\\) of the variability. It is a parsimonious model consisting of only \\(k = 4\\) of the original 45 variables. Table 3.4. Regression Coefficients from a Model of Female Advantage \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|rr} \\hline \\text{Variable} &amp; \\text{Coefficient} &amp; t\\text{-statistic} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Intercept} &amp; 9.904 &amp; 12.928 \\\\ \\text{Logarithmic Number of Persons per Physician} &amp; -0.473 &amp; -3.212 \\\\ \\text{Fertility} &amp; -0.444 &amp; -3.477 \\\\ \\text{Percentage of Hindus and Buddhists} &amp; -0.018 &amp; -3.196 \\\\ \\text{Soviet Union Dummy} &amp; 4.922 &amp; 7.235 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Source: Lemaire (2002) All variables were strongly statistically significant. The number of persons per physician was also correlated with other variables that capture a country’s degree of economic modernization, such as urbanization, number of cars, and the percentage working in agriculture. Fertility, the number of births per woman, was highly correlated with education variables in the study, including female illiteracy and female school enrollment. The percentage of Hindus and Buddhists is a social/cultural/religious variable. The Soviet Union dummy is a geographic variable - it characterizes Eastern European countries that formerly belonged to the Soviet Union. Because of the high degree of collinearity among the 45 candidate variables, other analysts could easily pick an alternative set of variables. Nonetheless, Lemaire’s important point was that this simple model explains roughly 61% of the variability based on only behavioral variables, unrelated to biological sex differences. 3.4 Statistical Inference for a Single Coefficient 3.4.1 The t-Test In many applications, a single variable is of primary interest, and other variables are included in the regression to control for additional sources of variability. To illustrate, a sales agent might be interested in the effect that income has on the quantity of insurance demanded. In a regression analysis, one could also include other explanatory variables such as an individual’s gender, type of occupation, age, size of the household, education level, and so on. By including these additional explanatory variables, we hope to gain a better understanding of the relationship between income and insurance demand. To reach sensible conclusions, we will need some rules to decide whether a variable is important or not. We respond to the question “Is \\(x_j\\) important?” by investigating whether or not the corresponding slope parameter, \\(\\beta_j\\), equals zero. The question is whether \\(\\beta_j\\) is zero can be restated in the hypothesis testing framework as “Is \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\) valid?” We examine the proximity of \\(b_j\\) to zero in order to determine whether or not \\(\\beta_j\\) is zero. Because the units of \\(b_j\\) depend on the units of \\(y\\) and \\(x_j\\), we need to standardize this quantity. From Property 2 and equation (3.6), we saw that \\(\\mathrm{Var~}b_j\\) is \\(\\sigma^2\\) times the \\((j+1)^{st}\\) diagonal element of \\((\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1}\\). Replacing \\(\\sigma^2\\) by the estimator \\(s^2\\) and taking square roots, we have the following. Definition. The standard error of \\(b_j\\) can be expressed as \\[ se(b_j) = s \\sqrt{\\text{(j+1)st diagonal element of } (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1}}. \\] Recall that a standard error is an estimated standard deviation. To test \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\), we examine the \\(t\\)-ratio, \\(t(b_j) = \\frac{b_j}{se(b_j)}\\). We interpret \\(t(b_j)\\) to be the number of standard errors that \\(b_j\\) is away from zero. This is the appropriate quantity because the sampling distribution of \\(t(b_j)\\) can be shown to be the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom, under the null hypothesis with the linear regression model assumptions F1-F5. This enables us to construct tests of the null hypothesis such as the following procedure: Procedure. The t-test for a Regression Coefficient (\\(\\beta\\)). The null hypothesis is \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\). The alternative hypothesis is \\(H_{a}:\\beta_j \\neq 0\\). Establish a significance level \\(\\alpha\\) (typically but not necessarily 5%). Construct the statistic, \\(t(b_j) = \\frac{b_j}{se(b_j)}\\). Procedure: Reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if \\(|t(b_j)|\\) exceeds a \\(t\\)-value. Here, this \\(t\\)-value is the \\((1-\\alpha /2)^{th}\\) percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution using \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom, denoted as \\(t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}\\). In many applications, the sample size will be large enough so that we may approximate the \\(t\\)-value by the corresponding percentile from the standard normal curve. At the 5% level of significance, this percentile is 1.96. Thus, as a rule of thumb, we can interpret a variable to be important if its \\(t\\)-ratio exceeds two in absolute value. Although it is the most common, testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j=0\\) versus \\(H_{a}:\\beta_j \\neq 0\\) is just one of many hypothesis tests that can be performed. Table 3.5 outlines alternative decision-making procedures. These procedures are for testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j = d\\). Here, \\(d\\) is a user-prescribed value that may be equal to zero or any other known value. Table 3.5. Decision-Making Procedures for Testing \\(H_0: \\beta_j = d\\) \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\hline \\text{Alternative Hypothesis }(H_{a}) &amp; \\text{Procedure: Reject } H_0 \\text{ in favor of } H_a \\text{ if }\\\\ \\hline \\beta_j &gt; d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&gt;t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha } \\\\ \\beta_j &lt; d &amp; t-\\mathrm{ratio}&lt;-t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha } \\\\ \\beta_j\\neq d &amp; |t-\\mathrm{ratio}\\mathit{|}&gt;t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha/2} \\end{array} \\\\ \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline \\textit{Notes:} &amp;\\text{ The significance level is } \\alpha. \\text{ Here, } t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha}\\text{ is the }(1-\\alpha)^{th}\\text{ percentile} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{from the }t-\\text{distribution using } df=n-(k+1)\\text{ degrees of freedom.} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_j -d)/se(b_j) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Alternatively, one can construct \\(p\\)-values and compare these to given significant levels. The \\(p\\)-value allows the report reader to understand the strength of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Table 3.6 summarizes the procedure for calculating \\(p\\)-values. Table 3.6. Probability Values for Testing \\(H_0:\\beta_j =d\\) \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cccc} \\hline \\text{Alternative} &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Hypothesis} (H_a ) &amp; \\beta_j &gt; d &amp; \\beta_j &lt; d &amp; \\beta_j \\neq d \\\\ \\hline p-value &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-(k+1)}&gt;t-ratio) &amp; \\Pr(t_{n-(k+1)}&lt;t-ratio) &amp; \\Pr(|t_{n-(k+1)}|&gt;|t-ratio|) \\\\ \\end{array} \\\\ \\begin{array}{ll}\\hline \\textit{Notes:} &amp; \\text{ Here, } t_{n-(k+1)} \\text{ is a }t\\text{-distributed random variable with }df=n-(k+1)\\text{ degrees of freedom.} \\\\ &amp;~~\\text{The test statistic is }t-\\mathrm{ratio} = (b_j -d)/se(b_j) . \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. A useful convention when reporting the results of a statistical analysis is to place the standard error of a statistic in parenthesis below that statistic. Thus, for example, in our regression of LNFACE on EDUCATION, NUMHH, and LNINCOME, the estimated regression equation is: \\[ \\begin{array}{lccccc} \\widehat{LNFACE} = &amp;2.584 ~ + &amp;0.206~ \\text{EDUCATION} + &amp;0.306 ~\\text{NUMHH} + &amp;0.494 ~\\text{LNINCOME}. \\\\ \\text{std error} &amp;(0.846) &amp;(0.039) &amp;(0.063) &amp;(0.078). \\end{array} \\] To illustrate the calculation of the standard errors, first note that from Table 3.3 we have that the residual standard deviation is \\(s=1.525\\). Using a statistical package, we have \\[ \\small{ (\\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.307975 &amp; -0.004633 &amp; -0.002131 &amp; -0.020697 \\\\ -0.004633 &amp; 0.000648 &amp; 0.000143 &amp; -0.000467 \\\\ -0.002131 &amp; 0.000143 &amp; 0.001724 &amp; -0.000453 \\\\ -0.020697 &amp; -0.000467 &amp; -0.000453 &amp; 0.002585 \\end{pmatrix}. } \\] To illustrate, we can compute \\(se(b_3)=s \\times \\sqrt{0.002585} = 0.078\\), as above. Calculation of the standard errors, as well as the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistics, is part of the standard output from statistical software and need not be computed by users. Our purpose here is to illustrate the ideas underlying the routine calculations. With this information, we can immediately compute \\(t\\)-ratios to check whether a coefficient associated with an individual variable is significantly different from zero. For example, the \\(t\\)-ratio for the LNINCOME variable is \\(t(b_3) = \\frac{0.494}{0.078} = 6.3\\). The interpretation is that \\(b_3\\) is over four standard errors above zero and thus LNINCOME is an important variable in the model. More formally, we may be interested in testing the null hypothesis that \\(H_0:\\beta_3 = 0\\) versus \\(H_0:\\beta_3 \\neq 0\\). At a 5% level of significance, the \\(t\\)-value is 1.96, because \\(df=275-(1+3)=271\\). We thus reject the null in favor of the alternative hypothesis, that logarithmic income (LNINCOME) is important in determining the logarithmic face amount. 3.4.2 Confidence Intervals Confidence intervals for parameters represent another device for describing the strength of the contribution of the \\(j\\)th explanatory variable. The statistic \\(b_j\\) is called a point estimate of the parameter \\(\\beta_j\\). To provide a range of reliability, we use the confidence interval: \\[\\begin{equation} b_j \\pm t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}~se(b_j). \\tag{3.10} \\end{equation}\\] Here, the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}\\) is a percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom. We use the same \\(t\\)-value as in the two-sided hypothesis test. Indeed, there is a duality between the confidence interval and the two-sided hypothesis test. For example, it is not hard to check that if a hypothesized value falls outside the confidence interval, then \\(H_0\\) will be rejected in favor of \\(H_{a}\\). Further, knowledge of the \\(p\\)-value, point estimate, and standard error can be used to determine a confidence interval. 3.4.3 Added Variable Plots To represent multivariate data graphically, we have seen that a scatterplot matrix is a useful device. However, the major shortcoming of the scatterplot matrix is that it only captures relationships between pairs of variables. When the data can be summarized using a regression model, a graphical device that does not have this shortcoming is an added variable plot. The added variable plot is also called a partial regression plot because, as we will see, it is constructed in terms of residuals from certain regression fits. We will also see that the added variable plot can be summarized in terms of a partial correlation coefficient, thus providing a link between correlation and regression. To introduce these ideas, we work in the context of the following example. Example: Refrigerator Prices. What characteristics of a refrigerator are important in determining its price (PRICE)? We consider here several characteristics of a refrigerator, including the size of the refrigerator in cubic feet (RSIZE), the size of the freezer compartment in cubic feet (FSIZE), the average amount of money spent per year to operate the refrigerator (ECOST, for “energy cost”), the number of shelves in the refrigerator and freezer doors (SHELVES), and the number of features (FEATURES). The features variable includes shelves for cans, see-through crispers, ice makers, egg racks, and so on. Both consumers and manufacturers are interested in models of refrigerator prices. Other things equal, consumers generally prefer larger refrigerators with lower energy costs that have more features. Due to forces of supply and demand, we would expect consumers to pay more for these refrigerators. A larger refrigerator with lower energy costs that has more features at a similar price is considered a bargain to the consumer. How much extra would the consumer be willing to pay for this additional space? A model of prices for refrigerators on the market provides some insight into this question. To this end, we analyze data from \\(n=37\\) refrigerators. Table 3.7 provides the basic summary statistics for the response variable PRICE and the five explanatory variables. From this table, we see that the average refrigerator price is \\(\\overline{y} = \\$626.40\\), with standard deviation \\(s_{y} = \\$139.80\\). Similarly, the average annual amount to operate a refrigerator, or average ECOST, is $70.51. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly.

From the table, we see that there are strong linear relationships between PRICE and each of freezer space (FSIZE) and the number of FEATURES. Surprisingly, there is also a strong positive correlation between PRICE and ECOST. Recall that ECOST is the energy cost; one might expect that higher-priced refrigerators should enjoy lower energy costs.

The fitted regression equation appears in Table 3.9, with \\(s=60.65\\) and \\(R^2=83.8\\%\\). Table 3.9: Fitted Refrigerator Price Model Coefficient Standard Error \\(t\\)-Ratio Intercept 798.00 271.400 -2.9 ECOST -6.96 2.275 -3.1 RSIZE 76.50 19.440 3.9 FSIZE 137.00 23.760 5.8 SHELVES 37.90 9.886 3.8 FEATURES 23.80 4.512 5.3 From Table 3.9, the explanatory variables seem to be useful predictors of refrigerator prices. Together, these variables account for 83.8% of the variability. For understanding prices, the typical error has dropped from \\(s_{y} = \\$139.80\\) to \\(s = \\$60.65\\). The \\(t\\)-ratios for each of the explanatory variables exceed two in absolute value, indicating that each variable is important on an individual basis. What is surprising about the regression fit is the negative coefficient associated with energy cost. Remember, we can interpret \\(b_{ECOST} = -6.96\\) to mean that, for each dollar increase in ECOST, we expect the PRICE to decrease by $6.96. This negative relationship conforms to our economic intuition. However, it is surprising that the same data set has shown us that there is a positive relationship between PRICE and ECOST. This seeming anomaly is because correlation only measures relationships between pairs of variables although the regression fit can account for several variables simultaneously. To provide more insight into this seeming anomaly, we now introduce the added variable plot. Producing an Added Variable Plot The added variable plot provides additional links between the regression methodology and more fundamental tools such as scatter plots and correlations. We work in the context of the Refrigerator Price Example to demonstrate the construction of this plot. Procedure for producing an added variable plot. Run a regression of PRICE on RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES, omitting ECOST. Compute the residuals from this regression, which we label \\(e_1\\). Run a regression of ECOST on RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. Compute the residuals from this regression, which we label \\(e_2\\). Plot \\(e_1\\) versus \\(e_2\\). This is the added variable plot of PRICE versus ECOST, controlling for the effects of the RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. This plot appears in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.4: An added variable plot. The residuals from the regression of PRICE on the explanatory variables, omitting ECOST, are on the horizontal axis. On the vertical axis are the residuals from the regression fit of ECOST on the other explanatory variables. The correlation coefficient is -0.48. R Code to Produce Figure 3.4 model.refrig1 &lt;- lm(PRICE ~ RSIZE + FSIZE + SHELVES + FEATURES, data = Refrig1) #summary(model.refrig1) model.refrig2 &lt;- lm(ECOST ~ RSIZE + FSIZE + SHELVES + FEATURES, data = Refrig1) #summary(model.refrig2) par(mar=c(4.1,4,.1,1), cex=1.1) plot(residuals(model.refrig2),residuals(model.refrig1), xlab=expression(e[1]),ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) mtext(expression(e[2]), side=2, at=0, line=3, las=1, cex=1.1) The error \\(\\varepsilon\\) can be interpreted as the natural variation in a sample. In many situations, this natural variation is small compared to the patterns evident in the nonrandom regression component. Thus, it is useful to think of the error, \\(\\varepsilon_i = y_i - \\left( \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_{ik} \\right)\\), as the response after controlling for the effects of the explanatory variables. In Section 3.3, we saw that a random error can be approximated by a residual, \\(e_i = y_i - \\left( b_0 + b_1 x_{i1} + \\cdots + b_k x_{ik} \\right)\\). Thus, in the same way, we may think of a residual as the response after “controlling for” the effects of the explanatory variables. With this in mind, we can interpret the vertical axis of Figure 3.4 as the refrigerator PRICE controlled for effects of RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. Similarly, we can interpret the horizontal axis as the ECOST controlled for effects of RSIZE, FSIZE, SHELVES, and FEATURES. The plot then provides a graphical representation of the relation between PRICE and ECOST, after controlling for the other explanatory variables. For comparison, a scatter plot of PRICE and ECOST (not shown here) does not control for other explanatory variables. Thus, it is possible that the positive relationship between PRICE and ECOST is not due to a causal relationship but rather one or more additional variables that cause both variables to be large. For example, from Table 3.8, we see that the freezer size (FSIZE) is positively correlated with both ECOST and PRICE. It certainly seems reasonable that increasing the size of a freezer would cause both the energy cost and the price to increase. Rather, the positive correlation may be due to the fact that large values of FSIZE mean large values of both ECOST and PRICE. Variables left out of a regression are called omitted variables. This omission could cause a serious problem in a regression model fit; regression coefficients could be not only strongly significant when they should not be, but they may also be of the incorrect sign. Selecting the proper set of variables to be included in the regression model is an important task; it is the subject of Chapters 5 and 6. 3.4.4 Partial Correlation Coefficients As we saw in Chapter 2, a correlation statistic is a useful quantity for summarizing plots. The correlation for the added variable plot is called a partial correlation coefficient. It is defined to be the correlation between the residuals \\(e_1\\) and \\(e_2\\) and is denoted by \\(r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k)\\). Because it summarizes an added variable plot, we may interpret \\(r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k)\\) to be the correlation between \\(y\\) and \\(x_j\\), in the presence of the other explanatory variables. To illustrate, the correlation between PRICE and ECOST in the presence of the other explanatory variables is -0.48. The partial correlation coefficient can also be calculated using \\[\\begin{equation} r(y,x_j | x_1, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_k) = \\frac{t(b_j)}{\\sqrt{t(b_j)^2 + n - (k + 1)}}. \\tag{3.11} \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(t(b_j)\\) is the \\(t\\)-ratio for \\(b_j\\) from a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\) (including the variable \\(x_j\\)). An important aspect of this equation is that it allows us to calculate partial correlation coefficients running only one regression. For example, from Table 3.9, the partial correlation between PRICE and ECOST in the presence of the other explanatory variables is \\(\\frac{-3.1}{\\sqrt{(-3.1)^2 + 37 - (5 + 1)}} \\approx -0.48\\). Calculation of partial correlation coefficients is quicker when using the relationship with the \\(t\\)-ratio, but may fail to detect nonlinear relationships. The information in Table 3.9 allows us to calculate all five partial correlation coefficients in the Refrigerator Price Example after running only one regression. The three-step procedure for producing added variable plots requires ten regressions, two for each of the five explanatory variables. Of course, by producing added variable plots, we can detect nonlinear relationships that are missed by correlation coefficients. Partial correlation coefficients provide another interpretation for \\(t\\)-ratios. The equation shows how to calculate a correlation statistic from a \\(t\\)-ratio, thus providing another link between correlation and regression analysis. Moreover, from the equation we see that the larger the \\(t\\)-ratio, the larger the partial correlation coefficient. That is, a large \\(t\\)-ratio means that there is a large correlation between the response and the explanatory variable, controlling for other explanatory variables. This provides a partial response to the question that is regularly asked by consumers of regression analyses, “Which variable is most important?” 3.5 Some Special Explanatory Variables The linear regression model is the basis of a rich family of models. This section provides several examples to illustrate the richness of this family. These examples demonstrate the use of (i) binary variables, (ii) transformation of explanatory variables, and (iii) interaction terms. This section also serves to underscore the meaning of the adjective linear in the phrase “linear regression”; the regression function is linear in the parameters but may be a highly nonlinear function of the explanatory variables. 3.5.1 Binary Variables Categorical variables provide a numerical label for measurements of observations that fall in distinct groups, or categories. Because of the grouping, categorical variables are discrete and generally take on a finite number of values. We begin our discussion with a categorical variable that can take on one of only two values, a binary variable. Further discussion of categorical variables is the topic of Chapter 4. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. We now consider the marital status of the survey respondent. In the Survey of Consumer Finances, respondents can select among several options describing their marital status including “married,” “living with a partner,” “divorced,” and so on. Marital status is not measured continuously but rather takes on values that fall into distinct groups. In this chapter, we group survey respondents according to whether or not they are single, defined to include those who are separated, divorced, widowed, never married, and are not married nor living with a partner. Chapter 4 will present a more complete analysis of marital status by including additional categories. The binary variable SINGLE is defined to be one if the survey respondent is single and 0 otherwise. The variable SINGLE is also known as an indicator variable because it indicates whether or not the respondent is single. Another name for this important type of variable is a dummy variable. We could use 0 and 100, or 20 and 36, or any other distinct values. However, 0 and 1 are convenient for the interpretation of the parameter values, discussed below. To streamline the discussion, we now present a model using only LNINCOME and SINGLE as explanatory variables. For our sample of \\(n = 275\\) households, 57 are single and the other 218 are not. To see the relationships among LNFACE, LNINCOME, and SINGLE, Figure 3.5 introduces a letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with SINGLE as the code variable. We can see that Figure 3.5 is a scatter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, using 50 randomly selected households from our sample of 275 (for clarity of the graph). However, instead of using the same plotting symbol for each observation, we have coded the symbols so that we can easily understand the behavior of a third variable, SINGLE. In other applications, you may elect to use other plotting symbols such as \\(\\clubsuit\\), \\(\\heartsuit\\), \\(\\spadesuit\\), and so on, or use different colors, to encode additional information. For this application, the letter codes “S” for single and “o” for other were selected because they remind the reader of the nature of the coding scheme. Regardless of the coding scheme, the important point is that a letter plot is a useful device for graphically portraying three or more variables in two dimensions. The main restriction is that the additional information must be categorized, such as with binary variables, to make the coding scheme work. Figure 3.5: Letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with the letter code ‘S’ for single and ‘o’ for other. The fitted regression lines have been superimposed. The lower line is for single and the upper line is for other. Figure 3.5 suggests that LNFACE is lower for those single than others for a given level of income. Thus, we now consider a regression model, LNFACE = β_0 + β_1 LNINCOME + β_2 SINGLE + ϵ. The regression function can be written as: \\[ \\text{E } y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; \\text{for other respondents} \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_1 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; \\text{for single respondents} \\end{cases} \\] The interpretation of the model coefficients differs from the continuous variable case. For continuous variables such as LNINCOME, we interpret \\(\\beta_1\\) as the expected change in \\(y\\) per unit change of logarithmic income, holding other variables fixed. For binary variables such as SINGLE, we interpret \\(\\beta_2\\) as the expected increase in \\(y\\) when going from the base level of SINGLE (=0) to the alternative level. Thus, although we have one model for both marital statuses, we can interpret the model using two regression equations, one for each type of marital status. By writing a separate equation for each marital status, we have been able to simplify a complicated multiple regression equation. Sometimes, you will find it easier to communicate a series of simple relationships compared to a single, complex relationship. Although the interpretation for binary explanatory variables differs from the continuous, the ordinary least squares estimation method remains valid. To illustrate, the fitted version of the above model is \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{cclll} \\widehat{LNFACE} &amp; = &amp; 5.09 &amp; + 0.634 \\text{LNINCOME} &amp; - 0.800 \\text{SINGLE} .\\\\ \\text{std error} &amp; &amp; (0.89) &amp; ~~(0.078) &amp; ~(0.248) \\\\ \\end{array} } \\] To interpret \\(b_2 = -0.800\\), we say that we expect the logarithmic face to be smaller by 0.80 for a survey respondent who is single compared to the other category. This assumes that other things, such as income, remain unchanged. For a graphical interpretation, the two fitted regression lines are superimposed in Figure 3.5. 3.5.2 Transforming Explanatory Variables Regression models have the ability to represent complex, nonlinear relationships between the expected response and the explanatory variables. For example, early regression texts, such as Plackett (1960, Chapter 6), devote an entire chapter of material to polynomial regression, \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2 + \\ldots + \\beta_p x^p. \\tag{3.12} \\end{equation}\\] Here, the idea is that a \\(p\\)th order polynomial in \\(x\\) can be used to approximate general, unknown nonlinear functions of \\(x\\). The modern-day treatment of polynomial regression does not require an entire chapter because the model in equation (3.12) can be expressed as a special case of the linear regression model. That is, with the regression function in equation (3.5), \\(\\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k\\), we can choose \\(k = p\\) and \\(x_1 =x\\), \\(x_2 = x^2\\), \\(\\ldots\\), \\(x_p = x^p\\). Thus, with these choices of explanatory variables, we can model a highly nonlinear function of \\(x\\). We are not restricted to powers of \\(x\\) in our choice of transformations. For example, the model \\(\\text{E } y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\ln x\\), provides another way to represent a gently sloping curve in \\(x\\). This model can be written as a special case of the basic linear regression model using \\(x^{\\ast} = \\ln x\\) as the transformed version of \\(x\\). Transformations of explanatory variables need not be smooth functions. To illustrate, in some applications, it is useful to categorize a continuous explanatory variable. For example, suppose that \\(x\\) represents the number of years of education, ranging from 0 to 17. If we are relying on information self-reported by our sample of senior citizens, there may be a substantial amount of error in the measurement of \\(x\\). We could elect to use a less informative, but more reliable, transform of \\(x\\) such as \\(x^{\\ast}\\), a binary variable for finishing 13 years of school (finishing high school). Formally, we would code \\(x^{\\ast} = 1\\) if \\(x \\geq 13\\) and \\(x^{\\ast} = 0\\) if \\(x &lt; 13\\). Thus, there are several ways that nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables can be used in the regression model. An example of a nonlinear regression model is \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\exp (\\beta_1 x) + \\varepsilon.\\) These typically arise in science applications of regressions where there are fundamental scientific principles guiding the complex model development. 3.5.3 Interaction Terms We have so far discussed how explanatory variables, say \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), affect the mean response in an additive fashion, that is, \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\). Here, we expect \\(y\\) to increase by \\(\\beta_1\\) per unit increase in \\(x_1\\), with \\(x_2\\) held fixed. What if the marginal rate of increase of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) differs for high values of \\(x_2\\) when compared to low values of \\(x_2\\)? One way to represent this is to create an interaction variable \\(x_3 = x_1 \\times x_2\\) and consider the model \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3\\). With this model, the change in the expected \\(y\\) per unit change in \\(x_1\\) now depends on \\(x_2\\). Formally, we can assess small changes in the regression function as: \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{E}~y}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\left(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2 \\right) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 x_2 . \\] In this way, we may allow for more complicated functions of \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). Figure 3.6 illustrates this complex structure. From this figure and the above calculations, we see that the partial changes of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) due to movement of \\(x_1\\) depend on the value of \\(x_2\\). In this way, we say that the partial changes due to each variable are not unrelated but rather “move together.” Figure 3.6: Plot of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_1 x_2\\) versus \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). More generally, an interaction term is a variable that is created as a nonlinear function of two or more explanatory variables. These special terms, even though permitting us to explore a rich family of nonlinear functions, can be cast as special cases of the linear regression model. To do this, we simply create the variable of interest and treat this new term as another explanatory variable. Of course, not every variable that we create will be useful. In some instances, the created variable will be so similar to variables already in our model that it will provide us with no new information. Fortunately, we can use \\(t\\)-tests to check whether the new variable is useful. Further, Chapter 4 will introduce a test to decide whether a group of variables is useful. The function that we use to create an interaction variable must be more than just a linear combination of other explanatory variables. For example, if we use \\(x_3 = x_1 + x_2\\), we will not be able to estimate all of the parameters. Chapter 5 will introduce some techniques to help avoid situations when one variable is a linear combination of the others. To give you some exposure to the wide variety of potential applications of special explanatory variables, we now present a series of short examples. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. How do we interpret the interaction of a binary variable with a continuous variable? To illustrate, consider a Term Life regression model, \\[ \\mathrm{LNFACE} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\mathrm{LNINCOME} + \\beta_2 \\mathrm{SINGLE} + \\beta_3 \\mathrm{LNINCOME*SINGLE} + \\varepsilon . \\] In this model, we have created a third explanatory variable through the interaction of LNINCOME and SINGLE. The regression function can be written as: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\mathrm{LNINCOME}, &amp; \\text{for other respondents}, \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3) \\mathrm{LNINCOME}, &amp; \\text{for single respondents}. \\end{cases} \\] Thus, through this single model with four parameters, we can create two separate regression lines, one for those single and one for others. Figure 3.7 shows the two fitted regression lines for our data. Figure 3.7: Letter plot of LNFACE versus LNINCOME, with the letter code S for single and o for other. The fitted regression lines have been superimposed. The lower line is for single and the upper line is for other. Example: Life Insurance Company Expenses. In a well-developed life insurance industry, minimizing expenses is critical for a company’s competitive position. Segal (2002) analyzed annual accounting data from over 100 firms for the period 1995-1998, inclusive, using a database from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) and other reported information. Segal modeled overall company expenses as a function of firm outputs and the price of inputs. The outputs consist of insurance production, measured by \\(x_1\\) through \\(x_5\\), described in Table 3.10. Segal also considered the square of each output, as well as an interaction term with a dummy/binary variable \\(D\\) that indicates whether or not the firm uses a branch company to distribute its products. (In a branch company, field managers are company employees, not independent agents.) Table 3.10.Twenty-Three Regression Coefficients from an Expense Cost Model \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|rrrr} \\hline &amp; \\text{Variable} &amp; &amp;\\text{Variable}&amp;\\text{ Squared} \\\\ &amp; \\text{Baseline} &amp; \\text{Interaction} &amp; \\text{Baseline} &amp; \\text{Interaction} \\\\ &amp; &amp; \\text{with}~~ &amp; &amp; \\text{with}~~ \\\\ \\text{Variable} &amp; (D=0) &amp; (D=1) &amp; (D=0) &amp; (D=1)\\\\ \\hline \\text{Number of Life Policies Issued } (x_1) &amp; -0.454 &amp; 0.152 &amp; 0.032 &amp; -0.007 \\\\ \\text{Amount of Term Life Insurance Sold } (x_2) &amp; 0.112 &amp; -0.206 &amp; 0.002 &amp; 0.005 \\\\ \\text{Amount of Whole Life Insurance Sold } (x_3) &amp; -0.184 &amp; 0.173 &amp; 0.008 &amp; -0.007 \\\\ \\text{Total Annuity Considerations } (x_4) &amp; 0.098 &amp; -0.169 &amp; -0.003 &amp; 0.009 \\\\ \\text{Total Accident and Health Premiums } (x_5) &amp;-0.171 &amp; 0.014 &amp; 0.010 &amp; 0.002 \\\\ \\text{Intercept } &amp; 7.726 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Price of Labor (PL)} &amp; 0.553 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\text{Price of Capital (PC)} &amp; 0.102 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\\\ \\begin{array}{l} \\textit{Note: } x_1 \\text{ through } x_5 \\text{ are in logarithmic units}.\\\\ \\textit{Source: Segal (2002)} \\end{array} } \\] For the price inputs, the price of labor (\\(PL\\)) is defined to be the total cost of employees and agents divided by their number, in logarithmic units. The price of capital (\\(PC\\)) is approximated by the ratio of capital expense to the number of employees and agents, also in logarithmic units. The price of materials consists of expenses other than labor and capital divided by the number of policies sold and terminated during the year. It does not appear directly as an explanatory variable. Rather, Segal took the dependent variable (\\(y\\)) to be total company expenses divided by the price of materials, again in logarithmic units. With these variable definitions, Segal estimated the following regression function: \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y=\\beta_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^5 \\left( \\beta_j x_j + \\beta_{j+5} D x_j + \\beta_{j+10} x_j^2 + \\beta_{j+15}D x_j^2 \\right) + \\beta_{21} PL + \\beta_{22} PC. \\] The parameter estimates appear in Table 3.10. For example, the marginal change in \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) per unit change in \\(x_1\\) is: \\[ \\frac{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{E}~y}{\\partial x_1}= \\beta_1 + \\beta_{6} D + 2 \\beta_{11} x_1 + 2 \\beta_{16}D x_1, \\] which is estimated as \\(-0.454 + 0.152 D + (0.064 - 0.014 D) x_1\\). For these data, the median number of policies issued was \\(x_1=15,944\\). At this value of \\(x_1\\), the estimated marginal change is \\(-0.454 + 0.152 D + (0.064 - 0.014 D) \\mathrm{ln}(15944) = 0.165 + 0.017 D,\\) or 0.165 for baseline \\((D=0)\\) and 0.182 for branch \\((D=1)\\) companies. These estimates are elasticities, as defined in Section 3.2.2. To interpret these coefficients further, let \\(COST\\) represent total general company expenses and \\(NUMPOL\\) represent the number of life policies issued. Then, for branch \\((D=1)\\) companies, we have: \\[ 0.182 \\approx \\frac{\\partial y }{\\partial x_1 } = \\frac{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{ln}~COST}{\\partial ~ \\mathrm{ln}~NUMPOL}= \\frac{ \\frac{\\partial ~ COST}{\\partial ~NUMPOL}} {\\frac{COST}{NUMPOL}}, \\] or \\(\\frac{\\partial ~ COST}{\\partial ~NUMPOL} \\approx 0.182 \\frac{COST}{NUMPOL}\\). The median cost is $15,992,000, so the marginal cost per policy at these median values is \\(0.182 \\times (15992000/15944) = \\$182.55\\). Special Case: Curvilinear Response Functions We can expand the polynomial functions of an explanatory variable to include several explanatory variables. For example, the expected response, or response function, for a second-order model with two explanatory variables is: \\[ \\mathrm{E} y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2. \\] Figure 3.8 illustrates this response function. Similarly, the response function for a second-order model with three explanatory variables is: \\[ \\mathrm{E} y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_{11} x_1^2 + \\beta_{22} x_2^2 + \\beta_{33} x_3^2 + \\beta_{12} x_1 x_2 + \\beta_{13} x_1 x_3 + \\beta_{23} x_2 x_3. \\] When there is more than one explanatory variable, third and higher-order models are rarely used in applications. Figure 3.8: Plot of \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1~x_1 + \\beta_2~x_2 + \\beta_{11}~x_1^2 + \\beta_{22}~x_2^2 + \\beta_{12}~x_1~x_2\\) versus \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\).

For example, suppose that we are trying to model an individual’s charitable contributions (\\(y\\)) in terms of their wages (\\(x\\)). For 2007 data, a simple model we might entertain is given in Figure 3.9. Figure 3.9: The marginal change in \\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\) is lower below $97,500. The parameter \\(\\beta_2\\) represents the difference in the slopes. R Code to Produce Figure 3.9 # FIGURE 3.9 x &lt;- seq(90000,105000,20) Ey &lt;- 20 + 1*x + 2*(x-97500)*(x&gt;97500) par(mar=c(4.1,3.1,.1,1), cex=1.3) plot(x,Ey, type=&quot;l&quot;,yaxt=&quot;n&quot;, ylab=&quot;&quot;, las=1) mtext(&quot;E y&quot;, side=2,las=1, line=1.5,cex=1.1) text(102000,102000,expression(beta[1]+beta[2]),cex=1.1) text(94000,92000,expression(beta[1]),cex=1.1) A rationale for this model is that, in 2007, individuals paid 7.65% of their income for Social Security taxes up to 97,500. No Social Security taxes are excised on wages in excess of 97,500. Thus, one theory is that, for wages in excess of $97,500, individuals have more disposable income per dollar and thus should be more willing to make charitable contributions. To model this relationship, define the binary variable \\(z\\) to be zero if \\(x &lt; 97,500\\) and to be one if \\(x \\ge 97,500\\). Define the regression function to be \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z (x - 97,500)\\). This can be written as: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x &amp; x &lt; 97,500 \\\\ \\beta_0 - \\beta_2(97,500) + (\\beta_1+\\beta_2) x &amp; x \\geq 97,500 \\end{cases} \\] To estimate this model, we would run a regression of \\(y\\) on two explanatory variables, \\(x_1 = x\\) and \\(x_2 = z \\times (x - 97,500)\\). If \\(\\beta_2 &gt; 0\\), then the marginal rate of charitable contributions is higher for incomes exceeding $97,500. Figure 3.9 illustrates this relationship, known as piecewise linear regression or sometimes a “broken stick” model. The sharp break in Figure 3.9 at \\(x = 97,500\\) is called a “kink.” We have linear relationships above and below the kinks and have used a binary variable to put the two pieces together. We are not restricted to one kink. For example, suppose that we wish to do a historical study of Federal taxable income for 1992 single filers. Then, there were three tax brackets: the marginal tax rate below 21,450 was 15%, above 51,900 was 31%, and in between was 28%. For this example, we would use two kinks, at 21,450 and 51,900. Further, piecewise linear regression is not restricted to continuous response functions. For example, suppose that we are studying the commissions paid to stockbrokers (\\(y\\)) in terms of the number of shares purchased by a client (\\(x\\)). We might expect to see the relationship illustrated in Figure 3.10. Here, the discontinuity at \\(x = 100\\) reflects the administrative expenses of trading in odd lots, as trades of less than 100 shares are called. The lower marginal cost for trades in excess of 100 shares simply reflects the economies of scale for doing business in larger volumes. A regression model of this is \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z + \\beta_3 z x\\) where \\(z = 0\\) if \\(x &lt; 100\\) and \\(z = 1\\) if \\(x \\geq 100\\). The regression function depicted in Figure 3.10 is: \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\begin{cases} \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 &amp; x &lt; 100 \\\\ \\beta_0 + \\beta_2 + (\\beta_1+\\beta_3) x_1 &amp; x \\geq 100 \\end{cases} \\] Figure 3.10: Plot of expected commissions (\\(\\mathrm{E}~y\\)) versus number of shares traded (\\(x\\)). The break at \\(x=100\\) reflects savings in administrative expenses. The lower slope for \\(x \\ge 100\\) reflects economies of scales in expenses.

You will be fitting a regression model to \\(y\\) using two explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\). \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{c|cccc} \\hline i &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\hline x_{i,1} &amp; -1 &amp; 2 &amp; 4 &amp; 6 \\\\ x_{i,2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ y_i &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 5 &amp; 8 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] From the fitted regression model, we have \\(s = 1.373\\) and \\[ \\small{ \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.1538 \\\\ 0.6923 \\\\ 2.8846 \\end{pmatrix} ~~~\\text{and}~~~ \\left(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime} X} \\right)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.53846 &amp; -0.07692 &amp; -0.15385 \\\\ -0.07692 &amp; 0.15385 &amp; -0.69231 \\\\ -0.15385 &amp; -0.69231 &amp; 4.11538 \\\\ \\end{pmatrix}. } \\] Write down the vector of dependent variables, \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), and the matrix of explanatory variables, \\(\\mathbf{X}\\).

Determine the numerical value for \\(t(b_1)\\). 3.4. Wisconsin Lottery. Section 2.1 described a sample of \\(n=50\\) geographic areas (zip codes) containing sales data on the Wisconsin state lottery (\\(y = \\text{SALES}\\)). In that section, sales were analyzed using a basic linear regression model with \\(x = \\text{POP}\\), the area population, as the explanatory variable. This exercise extends that analysis by introducing additional explanatory variables given in Table 3.11. \\[ \\text{Table 3.11: Lottery, economic and demographic characteristics of fifty Wisconsin ZIP codes} \\] \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline \\textbf{Lottery characteristics} \\\\ \\hline \\text{SALES} &amp; \\text{Online lottery sales to individual consumers} \\\\ \\hline \\textbf{Economic and } \\\\ ~~~~~\\textbf{demographic characteristics} \\\\\\hline \\text{PERPERHH} &amp; \\text{Persons per household} \\\\ \\text{MEDSCHYR} &amp; \\text{Median years of schooling} \\\\ \\text{MEDHVL} &amp; \\text{Median home value in \\$1000s for owner-occupied homes} \\\\ \\text{PRCRENT} &amp; \\text{Percent of housing that is renter occupied} \\\\ \\text{PRC55P} &amp; \\text{Percent of population that is 55 or older} \\\\ \\text{HHMEDAGE} &amp; \\text{Household median age} \\\\ \\text{MEDINC} &amp; \\text{Estimated median household income, in \\$1000s} \\\\ \\text{POP} &amp; \\text{Population} \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Produce a table of summary statistics for all variables. One zip code (observation 11, zip = 53211, Shorewood Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee) appears to have unusually large values of MEDSCHYR and MEDHVL. For this observation, how many standard deviations is the value of MEDSCHYR above the mean? For this observation, how many standard deviations is the value of MEDHVL above the mean? Produce a table of correlations. What three variables are most highly correlated with SALES? Produce a scatter plot matrix of all explanatory variables and SALES. In the plot of MEDSCHYR versus SALES, describe the position of observation 11. Fit a linear model of SALES on all eight explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\) and its adjusted version, \\(R_a^2\\). Based on your part (d) model fit, is MEDSCHYR a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Now fit a more parsimonious model, using SALES as the dependent variable and MEDSCHYR, MEDHVL and POP as explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\) and its adjusted version, \\(R_a^2\\). How do these values compare to the model fit in part (d)? Note that the sign of the regression coefficient associated with MEDSCHYR is negative. To help interpret this coefficient, compute the corresponding partial correlation coefficient. What is the interpretation of this coefficient? To get further insights into the relation between MEDSCHYR and SALES, produce an added variable plot controlling for the effects of MEDHVL and POP. Check that the correlation associated with this plot agrees with your answer in part (g). Re-run the regression in part (f), after removing observation 11. Cite the basic summary statistics from this regression. For this model fit, is MEDSCHYR a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion and your decision-making rule. Re-run the regression in part (f), after removing observation 9. Cite the basic summary statistics from this regression. 3.5. Insurance Company Expenses. This exercise considers insurance company data from the NAIC and described in Exercise 1. Table 3.10 describes several variables that can be used to explain expenses. As with Segal’s (2002) study of life insurers, firm “outputs” consist of premiums written (for property and casualty, these are subdivided into personal and commercial lines) as well as losses (subdivided into short and long tail lines). ASSETS and CASH are commonly used measures of the size of a company. GROUP, STOCK, and MUTUAL describe the organizational structure. Firm “inputs” were gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, from the Occupational Employee Statistics program). STAFFWAGE is calculated as the average wage in the state where the insurance company is headquartered. AGENTWAGE is calculated as the weighted average of annual wages of the brokerage industry, weighted by the percentage of gross premium written in each state. Table 3.10: Insurer Expense Variables Variable Description EXPENSES Total expenses incurred, in millions of dollars LONGLOSS Losses incurred for long tail lines, in millions of dollars SHORTLOSS Losses incurred for short tail lines, in millions of dollars GPWPERSONAL Gross premium written for personal lines, in millions of dollars GPWCOMM Gross premium written for commercial lines, in millions of dollars ASSETS Net admitted assets, in millions of dollars CASH Cash and invested assets, in millions of dollars GROUP Indicates if the company is affiliated STOCK Indicates if the company is a stock company MUTUAL Indicates if the company is a mutual company STAFFWAGE Annual average wage of the insurer’s administrative staff, in thousands of dollars AGENTWAGE Annual average wage of the insurance agent, in thousands of dollars A preliminary inspection of the data showed that many firms did not report any insurance losses incurred in 2005. For this exercise, we consider the 384 companies with some losses in the file NAICExpense.csv. Summary Statistics Produce summary statistics of the response variable and the (non-binary) explanatory variables. Note the pattern of skewness for each variable. Note that many variables have negative values. Transform Variables Transform each non-binary variable through the modified logarithm transform, \\(\\ln(1+x)\\). Produce summary statistics of these modified non-binary explanatory variables. Let LNEXPENSES (\\(= \\ln(1+\\text{EXPENSES})\\)) denote the modified expense variable. For subsequent analysis, use only the modified variables described in part (b). Correlation Table Produce a table of correlations for the non-binary variables. What three variables are most highly correlated with LNEXPENSES? Boxplot of LNEXPENSES by GROUP Provide a boxplot of LNEXPENSES by level of GROUP. Which level of group has higher expenses? Linear Model on All Variables Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on all eleven explanatory variables. Summarize the fit of this model by citing the residual standard deviation, \\(s\\), the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\), and its adjusted version, \\(R^2_a\\). Reduced Model Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on a reduced model using eight explanatory variables, dropping LNCASH, STOCK, and MUTUAL. For the explanatory variables, include ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses, and gross premiums, as well as the two BLS variables. f(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). f(ii). Interpret the coefficient associated with commercial lines gross premiums on the logarithmic scale. f(iii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase? Use your answer in part f(ii) and median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES for this question. Quadratic Terms Square each of the two loss and the two gross premium variables. Fit a linear model of LNEXPENSES on a reduced model using twelve explanatory variables, the eight variables in part (f) and the four additional squared terms just created. g(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). g(ii). Do the quadratic variables appear to be useful explanatory variables? Excluding BLS Variables Now omit the two BLS variables, so you are fitting a model of LNEXPENSES on ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses, and gross premiums, as well as quadratic terms. Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). Comment on the number of observations used to fit this model compared to part (f). Interaction Terms Drop the quadratic terms in part (g) and add interaction terms with the dummy variable GROUP. Thus, there are now eleven variables: ASSETS, GROUP, both versions of losses and gross premiums, as well as interactions of GROUP with ASSETS and both versions of losses and gross premiums. i(i). Summarize the fit of this model by citing \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), and \\(R^2_a\\). i(ii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase for GROUP=0 companies? Use the median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES of GROUP=0 companies for this question. i(iii). Suppose that GPWCOMM increases by $1, how much do we expect EXPENSES to increase for GROUP=1 companies? Use the median values of GPWCOMM and EXPENSES of GROUP=1 companies for this question. 3.6 National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercises 1 and 2. Now fit a regression model on LIFEEXP using three explanatory variables: FERTILITY, PUBLICEDUCATION, and lnHEALTH (the natural logarithmic transform of PRIVATEHEALTH). Interpretation of Public Education Coefficient Interpret the regression coefficient associated with PUBLICEDUCATION. Interpretation of Health Expenditures Coefficient Interpret the regression coefficient associated with HEALTH expenditures without using the logarithmic scale for expenditures. Statistical Significance of PUBLICEDUCATION Based on the model fit, is PUBLICEDUCATION a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rule. Added Variable Plot The negative sign of the PUBLICEDUCATION coefficient is surprising, given that the sign of the correlation between PUBLICEDUCATION and LIFEEXP is positive and intuition suggests a positive relation. To check this result, an added variable plot appears in Figure 3.11. d(i). For an added variable plot, describe its purpose and a method for producing it. d(ii). Calculate the correlation corresponding to the added variable plot that appears in Figure 3.11.

This chapter extends the discussion of multiple linear regression by introducing statistical inference for handling several coefficients simultaneously. To motivate this extension, this chapter considers coefficients associated with categorical variables. These variables allow us to group observations into distinct categories. This chapter shows how to incorporate categorical variables into regression functions using binary variables, thus considerably widening the scope of potential applications for regression analysis. Statistical inference for several coefficients allows analysts to make decisions about categorical variables, as well as other important applications. Categorical explanatory variables also provide the basis for an ANOVA model, a special type of regression model that permits easier analysis and interpretation. 4.1 The Role of Binary Variables Categorical variables provide labels for observations to denote membership in distinct groups, or categories. A binary variable is a special case of a categorical variable. To illustrate, a binary variable may tell us whether or not someone has health insurance. A categorical variable could tell us whether someone has: private group insurance (offered by employers and associations), private individual health insurance (through insurance companies), public insurance (such as Medicare or Medicaid), no health insurance. For categorical variables, there may or may not be an ordering of the groups. In health insurance, it is difficult to order these four categories and say which is “larger,” private group, private individual, public, or no health insurance. In contrast, for education, we might group individuals into “low,” “intermediate,” and “high” years of education. In this case, there is an ordering among groups based on the level of educational achievement. As we will see, this ordering may or may not provide information about the dependent variable. Factor is another term used for an unordered categorical explanatory variable. For ordered categorical variables, analysts typically assign a numerical score to each outcome and treat the variable as if it were continuous. For example, if we had three levels of education, we might employ ranks and use \\[ \\small{ \\text{EDUCATION} = \\begin{cases} 1 &amp; \\text{for low education} \\\\ 2 &amp; \\text{for intermediate education} \\\\ 3 &amp; \\text{for high education.} \\end{cases} } \\] An alternative would be to use a numerical score that approximates an underlying value of the category. For example, we might use \\[ \\small{ \\text{EDUCATION} = \\begin{cases} 6 &amp; \\text{for low education} \\\\ 10 &amp; \\text{for intermediate education} \\\\ 14 &amp; \\text{for high education.} \\end{cases} } \\] This gives the approximate number of years of schooling that individuals in each category completed. The assignment of numerical scores and treating the variable as continuous has important implications for the regression modeling interpretation. Recall that the regression coefficient is the marginal change in the expected response; in this case, the \\(\\beta\\) for education assesses the increase in \\(\\mathrm{E }~y\\) per unit change in EDUCATION. If we record EDUCATION as a rank in a regression model, then the \\(\\beta\\) for education corresponds to the increase in \\(\\mathrm{E }~y\\) moving from EDUCATION=1 to EDUCATION=2 (from low to intermediate); this increase is the same as moving from EDUCATION=2 to EDUCATION=3 (from intermediate to high). Do we want to model this increase as the same? This is an assumption that the analyst makes with this coding of EDUCATION; it may or may not be valid but certainly needs to be recognized. Because of this interpretation of coefficients, analysts rarely use ranks or other numerical scores to summarize unordered categorical variables. The most direct way of handling factors in regression is through the use of binary variables. A categorical variable with \\(c\\) levels can be represented using \\(c\\) binary variables, one for each category. For example, suppose that we were uncertain about the direction of the education effect and so decide to treat it as a factor. Then, we could code \\(c=3\\) binary variables: (1) a variable to indicate low education, (2) one to indicate intermediate education, and (3) one to indicate high education. These binary variables are often known as dummy variables. In regression analysis with an intercept term, we use only \\(c-1\\) of these binary variables; the remaining variable enters implicitly through the intercept term. By identifying a variable as a factor, most statistical software packages will automatically create binary variables for you. Through the use of binary variables, we do not make use of the ordering of categories within a factor. Because no assumption is made regarding the ordering of the categories, for the model fit it does not matter which variable is dropped with regard to the fit of the model. However, it does matter for the interpretation of the regression coefficients. Consider the following example. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. We now return to the marital status of respondents from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF). Recall that marital status is not measured continuously but rather takes on values that fall into distinct groups that we treat as unordered. In Chapter 3, we grouped survey respondents according to whether or not they are “single,” where being single includes never married, separated, divorced, widowed, and not married but living with a partner. We now supplement this by considering the categorical variable, MARSTAT, which represents the marital status of the survey respondent. This may be: 1, for married 2, for living with a partner 0, for other (SCF further breaks down this category into separated, divorced, widowed, never married, inapplicable, persons age 17 or less, and no further persons). As before, the dependent variable is \\(y =\\) LNFACE, the amount that the company will pay in the event of the death of the named insured (in logarithmic dollars). Table 4.1 summarizes the dependent variable by the level of the categorical variable. This table shows that the marital status “married” is the most prevalent in the sample and that those married choose to have the most life insurance coverage. Figure 4.1 gives a more complete picture of the distribution of LNFACE for each of the three types of marital status. The table and figure also suggest that those living together have less life insurance coverage than the other two categories.

To answer this, a regression was run using LNFACE as the response and five explanatory variables: three continuous and two binary (for marital status). Recall that our three continuous explanatory variables are: LNINCOME (logarithmic annual income), the number of years of EDUCATION of the survey respondent, and the number of household members, NUMHH. For the binary variables, first define MAR0 to be the binary variable that is one if MARSTAT=0 and zero otherwise. Similarly, define MAR1 and MAR2 to be binary variables that indicate MARSTAT=1 and MARSTAT=2, respectively. There is a perfect linear dependency among these three binary variables in that MAR0 + MAR1 + MAR2 = 1 for any survey respondent. Thus, we need only two of the three. However, there is not a perfect dependency among any two of the three. It turns out that cor(MAR0, MAR1) = -0.90, cor(MAR0, MAR2) = -0.10, and cor(MAR1, MAR2) = -0.34. A regression model was run using LNINCOME, EDUCATION, NUMHH, MAR0, and MAR2 as explanatory variables. The fitted regression equation turns out to be: \\[ \\small{ \\widehat{y} = 3.395 + 0.452 \\text{ LNINCOME} + 0.205 \\text{ EDUCATION} + 0.248 \\text{ NUMHH} - 0.557 \\text{ MAR0} - 0.789 \\text{ MAR2}. } \\] To interpret the regression coefficients associated with marital status, consider a respondent who is married. In this case, MAR0=0, MAR1=1, and MAR2=0, so that: \\[ \\small{ \\widehat{y}_m = 3.395 + 0.452 \\text{ LNINCOME} + 0.205 \\text{ EDUCATION} + 0.248 \\text{ NUMHH}. } \\] Similarly, if the respondent is coded as living together, then MAR0=0, MAR1=0, and MAR2=1, and: \\[ \\small{ \\widehat{y}_{lt} = 3.395 + 0.452 \\text{ LNINCOME} + 0.205 \\text{ EDUCATION} + 0.248 \\text{ NUMHH} - 0.789. } \\] The difference between \\(\\widehat{y}_m\\) and \\(\\widehat{y}_{lt}\\) is \\(0.789.\\) Thus, we may interpret the regression coefficient associated with MAR2, \\(-0.789\\), to be the difference in fitted values for someone living together compared to a similar person who is married (the omitted category). Similarly, we can interpret \\(-0.557\\) to be the difference between the “other” category and the married category, holding other explanatory variables fixed. For the difference in fitted values between the “other” and the “living together” categories, we may use \\(-0.557 - (-0.789) = 0.232.\\) Although the regression was run using MAR0 and MAR2, any two out of the three would produce the same ANOVA Table (Table 4.2). However, the choice of binary variables does impact the regression coefficients. Table 4.3 shows three models, omitting MAR1, MAR2, and MAR0, respectively. For each fit, the coefficients associated with the continuous variables remain the same. As we have seen, the binary variable interpretations are with respect to the omitted category, known as the reference level. Although they change from model to model, their overall interpretation remains the same. That is, if we would like to estimate the difference in coverage between the “other” and the “living together” category, the estimate would be \\(0.232\\), regardless of the model.

In particular, the \\(t\\)-ratios differ and give different appearances of statistical significance. For example, both of the \\(t\\)-ratios associated with marital status in Model 2 are less than 2 in absolute value, suggesting that marital status is unimportant. In contrast, both Models 1 and 3 have at least one marital status binary that exceeds 2 in absolute value, suggesting statistical significance. Thus, you can influence the appearance of statistical significance by altering the choice of the reference level. To assess the overall importance of marital status (not just each binary variable), Section 4.2 will introduce tests of sets of regression coefficients.

In one of many studies that resulted from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) introduced in Section 1.5, Keeler and Rolph (1988) investigated the effects of cost-sharing in insurance plans. For this study, 14 health insurance plans were grouped by the co-insurance rate (the percentage paid as out-of-pocket expenditures that varied by 0, 25, 50 and 95%). One of the 95% plans limited annual out-of-pocket outpatient expenditures to $150 per person ($450 per family), providing in effect an individual outpatient deductible. This plan was analyzed as a separate group so that there were \\(c=5\\) categories of insurance plans. In most insurance studies, individuals choose insurance plans making it difficult to assess cost-sharing effects because of adverse selection. Adverse selection can arise because individuals in poor chronic health are more likely to choose plans with less cost sharing, thus giving the appearance that less coverage leads to greater expenditures. In the Rand HIE, individuals were randomly assigned to plans, thus removing this potential source of bias. Keeler and Rolph (1988) organized an individual’s expenditures into episodes of treatment; each episode contains spending associated with a given bout of illness, chronic condition or procedure. Episodes were classified as hospital, dental or outpatient; this classification was based primarily on diagnoses, not by location of services. Thus, for example, outpatient services preceding or following a hospitalization, as well as related drugs and tests, were included as part of a hospital episode. For simplicity, here we report only results for hospital episodes. Although families were randomly assigned to plans, Keeler and Rolph (1988) used regression methods to control for participant attributes and isolate the effects of plan cost-sharing. Table 4.4 summarizes the regression coefficients, based on a sample of \\(n=1,967\\) episode expenditures. In this regression, logarithmic expenditure was the dependent variable. The cost-sharing categorical variable was decomposed into five binary variables so that no functional form was imposed on the response to insurance. These variables are “Co-ins25,” “Co-ins50,” and “Co-ins95,” for coinsurance rates 25, 50 and 95%, respectively, and “Indiv Deductible” for the plan with individual deductibles. The omitted variable is the free insurance plan with 0% coinsurance. The HIE was conducted in six cities; a categorical variable to control for the location was represented with five binary variables, Dayton, Fitchburg, Franklin, Charleston and Georgetown, with Seattle being the omitted variable. A categorical factor with \\(c=6\\) levels was used for age and sex; binary variables in the model consisted of “Age 0-2,” “Age 3-5,” “Age 6-17,” “Woman age 18-65,” and “Man age 46-65,” the omitted category was “Man age 18-45.” Other control variables included a health status scale, socioeconomic status, number of medical visits in the year prior to the experiment on a logarithmic scale and race. Table 4.4 summarizes the effects of the variables. As noted by Keeler and Rolph, there were large differences by site and age although the regression only served to summarize \\(R^2=11\\%\\) of the variability. For the cost-sharing variables, only “Co-ins95” was statistically significant, and this only at the 5% level, not the 1% level. The paper of Keeler and Rolph (1988) examines other types of episode expenditures, as well as the frequency of expenditures. They concluded that cost-sharing of health insurance plans has little effect on the amount of expenditures per episode although there are important differences in the frequency of episodes. This is because an episode of treatment is composed of two decisions. The amount of treatment is made jointly between the patient and the physician and is largely unaffected by the type of health insurance plan. The decision to seek health care treatment is made by the patient; this decision-making process is more susceptible to economic incentives in cost-sharing aspects of health insurance plans.

For example, when assessing the effect of a categorical variable with \\(c\\) levels, we need to say something jointly about the \\(c-1\\) binary variables that enter the regression equation. To do this, Section 4.2.1 introduces a method for handling linear combinations of regression coefficients. Section 4.2.2 shows how to test several linear combinations, and Section 4.2.3 presents other inference applications. 4.2.1 Sets of Regression Coefficients Recall that our regression coefficients are specified by \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\left( \\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_k \\right)^{\\prime},\\) a \\((k+1) \\times 1\\) vector. It will be convenient to express linear combinations of the regression coefficients using the notation \\(\\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\) where \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a \\(p \\times (k+1)\\) matrix that is user-specified and depends on the application. Some applications involve estimating \\(\\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). Others involve testing whether \\(\\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) equals a specific known value (denoted as \\(\\mathbf{d}\\)). We call \\(H_0:\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = d}\\) the general linear hypothesis. To demonstrate the broad variety of applications in which sets of regression coefficients can be used, we now present a series of special cases. Special Case 1: One Regression Coefficient. In Section 3.4, we investigated the importance of a single coefficient, say \\(\\beta_j.\\) We may express this coefficient as \\(\\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) by choosing \\(p=1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to be a \\(1 \\times (k+1)\\) vector with a one in the \\((j+1)\\)st column and zeros otherwise. These choices result in \\[ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =} \\left( 0~\\ldots~0~1~0~\\ldots~0\\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) = \\beta_j. \\] Special Case 2: Regression Function. Here, we choose \\(p=1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to be a \\(1 \\times (k+1)\\) vector representing the transpose of a set of explanatory variables. These choices result in \\[ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =} \\left( x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_k \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) = \\beta_0 x_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k = \\mathrm{E}~y, \\] the regression function. Special Case 3: Linear Combination of Regression Coefficients. When \\(p=1\\), we use the convention that lower-case bold letters are vectors and let \\(\\mathbf{C = c^{\\prime}} = \\left( c_0, \\ldots, c_k \\right)^{\\prime}\\). In this case, \\(\\mathbf{C} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is a generic linear combination of regression coefficients \\[ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = c_0 \\beta_0 + \\ldots + c_k \\beta_k}. \\] Special Case 4: Testing Equality of Regression Coefficients. Suppose that the interest is in testing \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2.\\) For this purpose, let \\(p=1\\), \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} = \\left( 0, 1, -1, 0, \\ldots, 0\\right),\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d} = 0\\). With these choices, we have \\[ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} = c^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =} \\left( 0, 1, -1, 0, \\ldots, 0\\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) = \\beta_1 - \\beta_2 = 0, \\] so that the general linear hypothesis reduces to \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2.\\) Special Case 5: Adequacy of the Model. It is customary in regression analysis to present a test of whether or not any of the explanatory variables are useful for explaining the response. Formally, this is a test of the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\beta_1=\\beta_2=\\ldots=\\beta_k=0\\). Note that, as a convention, one does not test whether or not the intercept is zero. To test this using the general linear hypothesis, we choose \\(p=k\\), \\(\\mathbf{d}=\\left( 0~\\ldots~0\\right)^{\\prime}\\) to be a \\(k \\times 1\\) vector of zeros and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) to be a \\(k \\times (k+1)\\) matrix such that \\[ \\small{ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccc} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{d}. } \\] Special Case 6: Testing Portions of the Model. Suppose that we are interested in comparing a full regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 +\\ldots + \\beta_k x_k + \\beta_{k+1} x_{k+1} + \\ldots + \\beta_{k+p} x_{k+p} \\] to a reduced regression function, \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k. \\] Beginning with the full regression, we see that if the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\beta_{k+1} = \\ldots = \\beta_{k+p} = 0\\) holds, then we arrive at the reduced regression. To illustrate, the variables \\(x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+p}\\) may refer to several binary variables representing a categorical variable and our interest is in whether the categorical variable is important. To test the importance of the categorical variable, we want to see whether the binary variables \\(x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+p}\\) jointly affect the dependent variables. To test this using the general linear hypothesis, we choose \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) such that \\[ \\small{ \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =}\\left( \\begin{array}{ccccccc} 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_k \\\\ \\beta_{k+1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_{k+p} \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\beta_{k+1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\beta_{k+p} \\end{array} \\right) =\\left( \\begin{array}{c} 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{array} \\right) =\\mathbf{d}. } \\] From a list of \\(k+p\\) variables \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_{k+p}\\), you may drop any \\(p\\) that you deem appropriate. The additional variables do not need to be the last \\(p\\) in the regression specification. Dropping \\(x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+p}\\) is for notational convenience only. 4.2.2 The General Linear Hypothesis To recap, the general linear hypothesis can be stated as \\(H_0:\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} =d}\\). Here, \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is a \\(p \\times (k+1)\\) matrix, \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is a \\(p \\times 1\\) vector, and both \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) are user-specified and depend on the application at hand. Although \\(k+1\\) is the number of regression coefficients, \\(p\\) is the number of restrictions under \\(H_0\\) on these coefficients. (For those readers with knowledge of advanced matrix algebra, \\(p\\) is the rank of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\).) This null hypothesis is tested against the alternative \\(H_a:\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\neq d}\\). This may be obvious, but we do require \\(p \\leq k+1\\) because we cannot test more constraints than free parameters. To understand the basis for the testing procedure, we first recall some of the basic properties of the regression coefficient estimators described in Section 3.3. Now, however, our goal is to understand properties of the linear combinations of regression coefficients specified by \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\). A natural estimator of this quantity is \\(\\mathbf{Cb}\\). It is easy to see that \\(\\mathbf{Cb}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), because \\(\\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{Cb=C}\\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{b=C \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\). Moreover, the variance is \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{Cb}\\right) \\mathbf{=C}\\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{b}\\right) \\mathbf{C}^{\\prime}=\\sigma^2 \\mathbf{C}\\left( \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{C}^{\\prime}\\). To assess the difference between \\(\\mathbf{d}\\), the hypothesized value of \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), and its estimated value, \\(\\mathbf{Cb}\\), we use the following statistic: \\[ F-\\text{ratio}=\\frac{(\\mathbf{Cb-d)}^{\\prime}\\left( \\mathbf{C}\\left( \\mathbf{X^{\\prime}X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{C}^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1}(\\mathbf{Cb-d)}}{ps_{full}^2}. \\tag{4.1} \\] Here, \\(s_{full}^2\\) is the mean square error from the full regression model. Using the theory of linear models, it can be checked that the statistic \\(F\\)-ratio has an \\(F\\)-distribution with numerator degrees of freedom \\(df_1=p\\) and denominator degrees of freedom \\(df_2=n-(k+1)\\). Both the statistic and the theoretical distribution are named for R. A. Fisher, a renowned scientist and statistician who did much to advance statistics as a science in the early half of the twentieth century. Like the normal and the \\(t\\)-distribution, the \\(F\\)-distribution is a continuous distribution. The \\(F\\)-distribution is the sampling distribution for the \\(F\\)-ratio and is proportional to the ratio of two sums of squares, each of which is positive or zero. Thus, unlike the normal distribution and the \\(t\\)-distribution, the \\(F\\)-distribution takes on only nonnegative values. Recall that the \\(t\\)-distribution is indexed by a single degree of freedom parameter. The \\(F\\)-distribution is indexed by two degrees of freedom parameters: one for the numerator, \\(df_1\\), and one for the denominator, \\(df_2\\). Appendix A3.4 provides additional details. The test statistic in equation (4.1) is complex in form. Fortunately, there is an alternative that is simpler to implement and to interpret; this alternative is based on the extra sum of squares principle. Procedure for Testing the General Linear Hypothesis Run the full regression and get the error sum of squares and mean square error, which we label as \\((Error~SS)_{full}\\) and \\(s_{full}^2\\), respectively. Consider the model assuming the null hypothesis is true. Run a regression with this model and get the error sum of squares, which we label \\((Error~SS)_{reduced}\\). Calculate \\[ F-\\text{ratio}=\\frac{(Error~SS)_{reduced}-(Error~SS)_{full}}{ps_{full}^2}. \\tag{4.2} \\] Reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative if the \\(F\\)-ratio exceeds an \\(F\\)-value. The \\(F\\)-value is a percentile from the \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1=p\\) and \\(df_2=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom. The percentile is one minus the significance level of the test. Following our notation with the \\(t\\)-distribution, we denote this percentile as \\(F_{p,n-(k+1),1-\\alpha}\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the significance level. This procedure is commonly known as an \\(F\\)-test. Section 4.7.2 provides the mathematical underpinnings. To understand the extra-sum-of-squares principle, recall that the error sum of squares for the full model is determined to be the minimum value of \\[ SS(b_0^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( y_i - \\left( b_0^{\\ast} + \\ldots + b_k^{\\ast} x_{i,k} \\right) \\right)^2. \\] Here, \\(SS(b_0^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})\\) is a function of \\(b_0^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}\\) and \\((Error~SS)_{full}\\) is the minimum over all possible values of \\(b_0^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast}\\). Similarly, \\((Error~SS)_{reduced}\\) is the minimum error sum of squares under the constraints in the null hypothesis. Because there are fewer possibilities under the null hypothesis, we have that \\[ (Error~SS)_{full} \\leq (Error~SS)_{reduced}. \\tag{4.3} \\] To illustrate, consider our first special case where \\(H_0 : \\beta_j = 0\\). In this case, the difference between the full and reduced models amounts to dropping a variable. A consequence of equation (4.3) is that, when adding variables to a regression model, the error sum of squares never goes up (and, in fact, usually goes down). Thus, adding variables to a regression model increases \\(R^2\\), the coefficient of determination. How large a decrease in the error sum of squares is statistically significant? Intuitively, one can view the \\(F\\)-ratio as the difference in the error sum of squares divided by the number of constraints, \\(\\frac{(Error~SS)_{reduced}-(Error~SS)_{full}}{p}\\), and then rescaled by the best estimate of the variance term, the \\(s^2\\), from the full model. Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows an \\(F\\)-distribution and we may compare the test statistic to this distribution to see if it is unusually large. Using the relationship \\(Regression~SS = Total~SS - Error~SS\\), we can re-express the difference in the error sum of squares as \\[ (Error~SS)_{reduced} - (Error~SS)_{full} = (Regression~SS)_{full} - (Regression~SS)_{reduced}. \\] This difference is known as a Type III Sum of Squares. When testing the importance of a set of explanatory variables, \\(x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+p}\\), in the presence of \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_k\\), you will find that many statistical software packages compute this quantity directly in a single regression run. The advantage of this is it allows the analyst to perform an \\(F\\)-test using a single regression run, instead of two regression runs as in our four-step procedure described above. Example: Term Life Insurance - Continued. Before discussing the logic and the implications of the \\(F\\)-test, let us illustrate its use. In the Term Life Insurance example, suppose that we wish to understand the impact of marital status. Table 4.3 presented a mixed message in terms of \\(t\\)-ratios; sometimes they were statistically significant and sometimes not. It would be helpful to have a formal test to give a definitive answer, at least in terms of statistical significance. Specifically, we consider a regression model using LNINCOME, EDUCATION, NUMHH, MAR0, and MAR2 as explanatory variables. The model equation is \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} y &amp;= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{LNINCOME} + \\beta_2 \\text{EDUCATION} + \\beta_3 \\text{NUMHH} \\\\ &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ + \\beta_4 \\text{MAR0} + \\beta_5 \\text{MAR2}. \\end{array} } \\] Our goal is to test \\(H_0: \\beta_4 = \\beta_5 = 0\\). We begin by running a regression model with all \\(k+p=5\\) variables. The results were reported in Table 4.2, where we saw that \\((Error~SS)_{full} = 615.62\\) and \\(s_{full}^2 = (1.513)^2 = 2.289\\). The next step is to run the reduced model without MAR0 and MAR2. This was done in Table 3.3 of Chapter 3, where we saw that \\((Error~SS)_{reduced} = 630.43\\). We then calculate the test statistic \\[ F-\\text{ratio} = \\frac{(Error~SS)_{reduced} - (Error~SS)_{full}}{ps_{full}^2} = \\frac{630.43 - 615.62}{2 \\times 2.289} = 3.235. \\] The fourth step compares the test statistic to an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1=p=2\\) and \\(df_2 = n-(k+p+1) = 269\\) degrees of freedom. Using a 5% level of significance, it turns out that the 95th percentile is \\(F-\\text{value} \\approx 3.029\\). The corresponding \\(p\\)-value is \\(\\Pr(F &gt; 3.235) = 0.0409\\). At the 5% significance level, we reject the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_4 = \\beta_5 = 0\\). This suggests that it is important to use marital status to understand term life insurance coverage, even in the presence of income, education, and number of household members. Some Special Cases The general linear hypothesis test is available when you can express one model as a subset of another. For this reason, it is useful to think of it as a device for comparing “smaller” to “larger” models. However, the smaller model must be a subset of the larger model. For example, the general linear hypothesis test cannot be used to compare the regression functions \\(\\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_7 x_7\\) versus \\(\\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_4\\). This is because the former, smaller function is not a subset of the latter, larger function. The general linear hypothesis can be used in many instances, although its use is not always necessary. For example, suppose that we wish to test \\(H_0:\\beta_k=0\\). We have already seen that this null hypothesis can be examined using the \\(t\\)-ratio test. In this special case, it turns out that \\((t-\\textrm{ratio})^2=F-\\textrm{ratio}\\). Thus, these tests are equivalent for testing \\(H_0:\\beta_k=0\\) versus \\(H_a:\\beta_k \\neq 0\\). The \\(F\\)-test has the advantage that it works for more than one predictor whereas the \\(t\\)-test has the advantage that one can consider one-sided alternatives. Thus, both tests are considered useful. Dividing the numerator and denominator of equation (4.4) by \\(Total~SS\\), the test statistic can also be written as: \\[ F-\\textrm{ratio}=\\frac{\\left( R_{full}^2-R_{reduced}^2\\right) /p}{\\left( 1-R_{full}^2\\right) / (n-(k+1))}. \\tag{4.4} \\] The interpretation of this expression is that the \\(F\\)-ratio measures the drop in the coefficient of determination, \\(R^2\\). The expression in equation (4.4) is particularly useful for testing the adequacy of the model, our Special Case 5. In this case, \\(p=k\\), and the regression sum of squares under the reduced model is zero. Thus, we have \\[ \\small{ F-\\textrm{ratio}=\\frac{\\left( (Regression~SS)_{full}\\right) /k}{s_{full}^2} =\\frac{(Regression~MS)_{full}}{(Error~SS)_{full}}. } \\] This test statistic is a regular feature of the ANOVA table for many statistical packages. For example, in our Term Life Insurance example, testing the adequacy of the model means evaluating \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 =\\beta_3 =\\beta_4 =\\beta_5 = 0\\). From Table 4.2, the \\(F\\)-ratio is 68.66 / 2.29 = 29.98. With \\(df_1=5\\) and \\(df_2 = 269\\), we have that the \\(F\\)-value is approximately 2.248 and the corresponding \\(p\\)-value is \\(\\Pr(F &gt; 29.98) \\approx 0\\). This leads us to reject strongly the notion that the explanatory variables are not useful in understanding term life insurance coverage, reaffirming what we learned in the graphical and correlation analysis. Any other result would be surprising. For another expression, dividing by \\(Total~SS\\), we may write \\[ F-\\textrm{ratio}=\\frac{R^2}{1-R^2}\\frac{n-(k+1)}{k}. \\] Because both \\(F\\)-ratio and \\(R^2\\) are measures of model fit, it seems intuitively plausible that they be related in some fashion. A consequence of this relationship is the fact that as \\(R^2\\) increases, so does the \\(F\\)-ratio and vice versa. The \\(F\\)-ratio is used because its sampling distribution is known under a null hypothesis so we can make statements about statistical significance. The \\(R^2\\) measure is used because of the easy interpretations associated with it. 4.2.3 Estimating and Predicting Several Coefficients Estimating Linear Combinations of Regression Coefficients In some applications, the main interest is to estimate a linear combination of regression coefficients. To illustrate, recall in Section 3.5 that we developed a regression function for an individual’s charitable contributions (\\(y\\)) in terms of their wages (\\(x\\)). In this function, there was an abrupt change in the function at \\(x=97,500\\). To model this, we defined the binary variable \\(z\\) to be zero if \\(x&lt;97,500\\) and to be one if \\(x \\geq 97,500\\), and the regression function \\(\\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 z(x - 97,500)\\). Thus, the marginal expected change in contributions per dollar wage change for wages in excess of \\(97,500\\) is \\(\\frac{\\partial \\left( \\mathrm{E~}y\\right)}{\\partial x} = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\). To estimate \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\), a reasonable estimator is \\(b_1 + b_2\\) which is readily available from standard regression software. In addition, we would also like to compute standard errors for \\(b_1 + b_2\\) to be used, for example, in determining a confidence interval for \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\). However, \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) are typically correlated so that the calculation of the standard error of \\(b_1 + b_2\\) requires estimation of the covariance between \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\). Estimating \\(\\beta_1 + \\beta_2\\) is an example of our Special Case 3 that considers linear combinations of regression coefficients of the form \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta = c_0 \\beta_0 + c_1 \\beta_1 + \\ldots + c_k \\beta_k\\). For our charitable contribution’s example, we would choose \\(c_1 = c_2 = 1\\) and other \\(c\\)’s equal to zero. To estimate \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\), we replace the vector of parameters by the vector of estimators and use \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}\\). To assess the reliability of this estimator, as in Section 4.2.2, we have that \\(\\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}\\right) = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{c}^{\\prime}(\\mathbf{X^{\\prime} X})^{-1} \\mathbf{c}\\). Thus, we may define the estimated standard deviation, or standard error, of \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}\\) to be \\[ se\\left( \\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} \\right) = s \\sqrt{\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{c}}. \\] With this quantity, a \\(100(1 - \\alpha) \\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is \\[ \\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} \\pm t_{n - (k + 1), 1 - \\alpha / 2} ~ se(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}). \\tag{4.5} \\] The confidence interval in equation (4.5) is valid under Assumptions F1-F5. If we choose \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) to have a “1” in the \\((j + 1)^{\\text{st}}\\) row and zeros otherwise, then \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\beta_j\\), \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} = b_j\\), and \\[ se(b_j) = s \\sqrt{(j + 1)^{\\text{st}}~ \\textit{diagonal element of } (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}}. \\] Thus, equation (4.5) provides a theoretical basis for the individual regression coefficient confidence intervals introduced in Section 3.4’s equation (3.10) and generalizes it to arbitrary linear combinations of regression coefficients. Another important application of equation (4.5) is the choice of \\(\\mathbf{c}\\) corresponding to a set of explanatory variables of interest, say, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\ast} = \\left( 1, x_{\\ast 1}, x_{\\ast 2}, \\ldots, x_{\\ast k} \\right)^{\\prime}\\). These may correspond to an observation within the data set or to a point outside the available data. The parameter of interest, \\(\\mathbf{c}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\), is the expected response or the regression function at that point. Then, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}\\) provides a point estimator and equation (4.5) provides the corresponding confidence interval. Prediction Intervals Prediction is an inferential goal that is closely related to estimating the regression function at a point. Suppose that, when considering charitable contributions, we know an individual’s wages (and thus whether wages are in excess of \\(97,500\\)) and wish to predict the amount of charitable contributions. In general, we assume that the set of explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}\\) is known and wish to predict the corresponding response \\(y_{\\ast}\\). This new response follows the assumptions as described in Section 3.2. Specifically, the expected response is \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_{\\ast} = \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\), \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}\\) is nonstochastic, \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_{\\ast} = \\sigma^2\\), \\(y_{\\ast}\\) is independent of \\(\\{y_1, \\ldots, y_{n}\\}\\) and is normally distributed. Under these assumptions, a \\(100(1 - \\alpha)\\%\\) prediction interval for \\(y_{\\ast}\\) is \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} \\pm t_{n - (k + 1), 1 - \\alpha / 2} ~ s \\sqrt{1 + \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}}. \\tag{4.6} \\] Equation (4.6) generalizes the prediction interval introduced in Section 2.4. 4.3 One Factor ANOVA Model Section 4.1 showed how to incorporate unordered categorical variables, or factors, into a linear regression model through the use of binary variables. Factors are important in social science research; they can be used to classify people by gender, ethnicity, marital status and so on, or classify firms by geographic region, organizational structure and so forth. Within studies of insurance, factors are used by insurers to categorize policyholders according to a “risk classification system.” Here, the idea is to create groups of policyholders with similar risk characteristics that will have similar claims experience. These groups form the basis of insurance pricing, so that each policyholder is charged an amount that is appropriate to their risk category. This process is sometimes known as “segmentation.” Although factors may be represented as binary variables in a linear regression model, we study one factor models as a separate unit because: The method of least squares is much simpler, obviating the need to take inverses of high-dimensional matrices. The resulting interpretations of coefficients are more straightforward. The one factor model is still a special case of the linear regression model. Hence, no additional statistical theory is needed to establish its statistical inference capabilities. To establish notation for the one factor ANOVA model, we now consider the following example. Example: Automobile Insurance Claims. We examine claims experience from a large midwestern (US) property and casualty insurer for private passenger automobile insurance. The dependent variable is the amount paid on a closed claim, in (US) dollars (claims that were not closed by year end are handled separately). Insurers categorize policyholders according to a risk classification system. This insurer’s risk classification system is based on: Automobile operator characteristics (age, gender, marital status and whether the primary or occasional driver of a car). Vehicle characteristics (city versus farm usage, if the vehicle is used to commute to school or work, used for business or pleasure, and if commuting, the approximate distance of the commute). These factors are summarized by the risk class categorical variable CLASS. Table 4.5 shows 18 risk classes - further classification information is not given here to protect proprietary interests of the insurer. Table 4.5 summarizes the results from \\(n=6,773\\) claims for drivers aged 50 and above. We can see that the median claim varies from a low of $707.40 (CLASS F7) to a high of 1,231.25 (CLASS C72). The distribution of claims turns out to be skewed, so we consider \\(y\\) = logarithmic claims. The table presents means, medians and standard deviations. Because the distribution of logarithmic claims is less skewed, means are close to medians. Figure 4.2 shows the distribution of logarithmic claims by risk class.

We use the notation \\(y_{ij}\\) to mean the \\(i\\)th observation of the \\(j\\)th risk class. For the \\(j\\)th risk class, we assume there are \\(n_j\\) observations. There are \\(n=n_1+n_2+\\ldots +n_c\\) observations. The data are: \\[ \\begin{array}{cccccc} \\text{Data for risk class }1 &amp; \\ \\ \\ \\ &amp; y_{11} &amp; y_{21} &amp; \\ldots &amp; y_{n_1,1} \\\\ \\text{Data for risk class }2 &amp; &amp; y_{12} &amp; y_{22} &amp; \\ldots &amp; y_{n_2,1} \\\\ . &amp; &amp; . &amp; . &amp; \\ldots &amp; . \\\\ \\text{Data for risk class } c &amp; &amp; y_{1c} &amp; y_{2c} &amp; \\ldots &amp; y_{n_c,c} \\end{array} \\] where \\(c=18\\) is the number of levels of the CLASS factor. Because each level of a factor can be arranged in a single row (or column), another term for this type of data is a “one way classification.” Thus, a one way model is another term for a one factor model. An important summary measure of each level of the factor is the sample average. Let \\[ \\overline{y}_j=\\frac{1}{n_j}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}y_{ij} \\] denote the average from the \\(j\\)th CLASS. Model Assumptions and Analysis The one factor ANOVA model equation is \\[ y_{ij}=\\mu_j+ \\varepsilon_{ij}\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ i=1,\\ldots ,n_j,\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ j=1,\\ldots ,c. \\tag{4.7} \\] As with regression models, the random deviations \\(\\{\\varepsilon_{ij} \\}\\) are assumed to be zero mean with constant variance (Assumption E3) and independent of one another (Assumption E4). Because we assume the expected value of each deviation is zero, we have \\(\\text{E}~y_{ij}=\\mu_j\\). Thus, we interpret \\(\\mu_j\\) to be the expected value of the response \\(y_{ij}\\), that is, the mean \\(\\mu\\) varies by the \\(j\\)th factor level. To estimate the parameters \\(\\{\\mu_j\\}\\), as with regression we use the method of least squares, introduced in Section 2.1. That is, let \\(\\mu^{\\ast}_j\\) be a “candidate” estimate of \\(\\mu_j\\). The quantity \\[ SS(\\mu^{\\ast}_1, \\ldots , \\mu^{\\ast}_{c}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{c} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (y_{ij}-\\mu^{\\ast}_j)^2 \\] represents the sum of squared deviations of the responses from these candidate estimates. From straightforward algebra, the value of \\(\\mu^{\\ast}_j\\) that minimizes this sum of squares is \\(\\bar{y}_j\\). Thus, \\(\\bar{y}_j\\) is the least squares estimate of \\(\\mu_j\\). To understand the reliability of the estimates, we can partition the variability as in the regression case, presented in Sections 2.3.1 and 3.3. The minimum sum of squared deviations is called the error sum of squares and is defined to be \\[ Error ~SS = SS(\\bar{y}_1, \\ldots, \\bar{y}_{c}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{c} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \\left(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_j \\right)^2. \\] The total variation in the data set is summarized by the total sum of squares, \\[ Total ~SS=\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y})^2. \\] The difference, called the factor sum of squares, can be expressed as: \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} Factor~ SS &amp; = Total ~SS - Error ~SS \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y})^2-\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(y_{ij}-\\bar{y}_j)^2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(\\bar{y}_j-\\bar{y})^2 \\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{j=1}^{c}n_j(\\bar{y}_j-\\bar{y})^2. \\end{array} \\] The last two equalities follow from algebra manipulation. The \\(Factor ~SS\\) plays the same role as the \\(Regression ~SS\\) in Chapters 2 and 3. The variability decomposition is summarized in Table 4.6. Table 4.6: ANOVA Table for One Factor Model Source Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square Factor \\(Factor ~SS\\) \\(c-1\\) \\(Factor ~MS\\) Error \\(Error ~SS\\) \\(n-c\\) \\(Error ~MS\\) Total \\(Total ~SS\\) \\(n-1\\) The conventions for this table are the same as in the regression case. That is, the mean square (MS) column is defined by the sum of squares (SS) column divided by the degrees of freedom (df) column. Thus, \\(Factor~MS \\equiv (Factor~SS)/(c-1)\\) and \\(Error~MS \\equiv (Error~SS)/(n-c)\\). We use \\[ s^2 = \\text{Error MS} = \\frac{1}{n-c} \\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} e_{ij}^2 \\] to be our estimate of \\(\\sigma^2\\), where \\(e_{ij} = y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_j\\) is the residual. With this value for \\(s\\), it can be shown that the interval estimate for \\(\\mu_j\\) is \\[ \\bar{y}_j \\pm t_{n-c,1-\\alpha /2}\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n_j}}. \\tag{4.8} \\] Here, the t-value \\(t_{n-c,1-\\alpha /2}\\) is a percentile from the t-distribution with \\(df=n-c\\) degrees of freedom. Example: Automobile Claims - Continued. To illustrate, the ANOVA table summarizing the fit for the automobile claims data appears in Table 4.7. Here, we see that the mean square error is \\(s^2 = 1.14.\\) Table 4.7: ANOVA Table for Logarithmic Automobile Claims Source Sum of Squares \\(df\\) Mean Square CLASS 39.2 17 2.31 Error 7729.0 6755 1.14 Total 7768.2 6772 In automobile ratemaking, one uses the average claims to help set prices for insurance coverages. As an example, for CLASS C72 the average logarithmic claim is 7.183. From equation (4.8), a 95% confidence interval is \\[ 7.183 \\pm (1.96) \\frac{\\sqrt{1.14}}{\\sqrt{85}} = 7.183 \\pm 0.227 = (6.956 ,7.410). \\] Note that these estimates are in natural logarithmic units. In dollars, our point estimate is \\(e^{7.183} = 1,316.85\\) and our 95% confidence interval is \\((e^{6.956} , e^{7.410}) \\text{ or } (\\$1,049.43, \\$1,652.43)\\). An important feature of the one factor ANOVA decomposition and estimation is the ease of computation. Although the sum of squares appear complex, it is important to note that no matrix calculations are required. Rather, all of the calculations can be done through averages and sums of squares. This has been an important consideration historically, before the age of readily available desktop computing. Moreover, insurers may segment their portfolios into hundreds or even thousands of risk classes instead of the 18 used in our Automobile Claims data. Thus, even today it can be helpful to identify a categorical variable as a factor and let your statistical software use ANOVA estimation techniques. Further, ANOVA estimation also provides for direct interpretation of the results. Link with Regression This subsection shows how a one factor ANOVA model can be rewritten as a regression model. To this end, we have seen that both the regression model and one factor ANOVA model use a linear error structure with Assumptions E3 and E4 for identically and independently distributed errors. Similarly, both use the normality assumption E5 for selected inference results (such as confidence intervals). Both employ non-stochastic explanatory variables as in Assumption E2. Both have an additive (mean zero) error term, so the main apparent difference is in the expected response, \\(\\mathrm{E }~y\\). For the linear regression model, \\(\\mathrm{E }~y\\) is a linear combination of explanatory variables (Assumption F1). For the one factor ANOVA model, \\(E[y_j] = \\mu_j\\) is a mean that depends on the level of the factor. To equate these two approaches, for the ANOVA factor with \\(c\\) levels, we define \\(c\\) binary variables, \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_c\\). Here, \\(x_j\\) indicates whether or not an observation falls in the \\(j\\)th level. With these variables, we can rewrite our one factor ANOVA model as \\[ y = \\mu_1 x_1 + \\mu_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\mu_c x_c + \\varepsilon. \\tag{4.9} \\] Thus, we have re-written the one factor ANOVA expected response as a regression function, although using a no-intercept form (as in equation (3.5)). The one factor ANOVA is a special case of our usual regression model, using binary variables from the factor as explanatory variables in the regression function. As we have seen, no matrix calculations are needed for least squares estimation. However, one can always use the matrix procedures developed in Chapter 3. Section 4.7.1 shows how our usual matrix expression for regression coefficients (\\(\\mathbf{b} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}\\)) reduces to the simple estimates \\(\\bar{y}_j\\) when using only one categorical variable. Reparameterization To include an intercept term, define \\(\\tau_j = \\mu_j - \\mu\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is an, as yet, unspecified parameter. Because each observation must fall into one of the \\(c\\) categories, we have \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{c} = 1\\) for each observation. Thus, using \\(\\mu_j = \\tau_j + \\mu\\) in equation (4.9), we have \\[ y = \\mu + \\tau_1 x_1 + \\tau_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\tau_{c} x_{c} + \\varepsilon, \\tag{4.10} \\] we have re-written the model into what appears to be our usual regression format. We use the \\(\\tau\\) in lieu of \\(\\beta\\) for historical reasons. ANOVA models were invented by R.A. Fisher in connection with agricultural experiments. Here, the typical set-up is to apply several treatments to plots of land in order to quantify crop yield responses. Thus, the Greek “t”, \\(\\tau\\), suggests the word treatment, another term used to describe levels of the factor of interest. A simpler version of equation (4.10) \\[ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}. \\] can be given when we identify the factor level. That is, if we know an observation falls in the \\(j\\)th level, then only \\(x_j\\) is one and the other \\(x\\)’s are 0. Thus, a simpler expression for equation (4.10) \\[ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}. \\] Comparing equations (4.9) and (4.10), we see that the number of parameters has increased by one. That is, in equation (4.9) there are \\(c\\) parameters, \\(\\mu_1, \\ldots, \\mu_c\\), even though in equation (4.10) there are \\(c + 1\\) parameters, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_c\\). The model in equation (4.10) is said to be overparameterized. It is possible to estimate this model directly, using the general theory of linear models, summarized in Section 4.7.3. In this theory, regression coefficients need not be identifiable. Alternatively, one can make these two expressions equivalent by restricting the movement of the parameters in equation (4.10). We now present two ways of imposing restrictions. The first type of restriction, usually done in the regression context, is to require one of the \\(\\tau\\)’s to be zero. This amounts to dropping one of the explanatory variables. For example, we might use \\[ y = \\mu + \\tau_1 x_1 + \\tau_2 x_2 + \\ldots + \\tau_{c-1} x_{c-1} + \\varepsilon, \\tag{4.11} \\] dropping \\(x_c\\). With this formulation, it is easy to fit the model in equation (4.11) using regression statistical software routines because one only needs to run the regression with \\(c-1\\) explanatory variables. However, one needs to be careful with the interpretation of parameters. To equate the models in equations (4.9) and (4.10), we need to define \\(\\mu \\equiv \\mu_c\\) and \\(\\tau_j = \\mu_j - \\mu_c\\) for \\(j=1,2,\\ldots,c-1\\). That is, the regression intercept term is the mean level of the category dropped, and each regression coefficient is the difference between a mean level and the mean level dropped. It is not necessary to drop the last level \\(c\\), and indeed, one could drop any level. However, the interpretation of the parameters does depend on the variable dropped. With this restriction, the fitted values are \\(\\hat{\\mu} = \\hat{\\mu}_c = \\bar{y}_c\\) and \\(\\hat{\\tau}_j = \\hat{\\mu}_j - \\hat{\\mu}_c = \\bar{y}_j - \\bar{y}_c.\\) Recall that the caret (\\(\\hat{\\cdot}\\)), or “hat,” stands for an estimated, or fitted, value. The second type of restriction is to interpret \\(\\mu\\) as a mean for the entire population. To this end, the usual requirement is \\(\\mu \\equiv \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^c n_j \\mu_j,\\) that is, \\(\\mu\\) is a weighted average of means. With this definition, we interpret \\(\\tau_j = \\mu_j - \\mu\\) as treatment differences between a mean level and the population mean. Another way of expressing this restriction is \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{c} n_j \\tau_j = 0,\\) that is, the (weighted) sum of treatment differences is zero. The disadvantage of this restriction is that it is not readily implementable with a regression routine and a special routine is needed. The advantage is that there is a symmetry in the definitions of the parameters. There is no need to worry about which variable is being dropped from the equation, an important consideration. With this restriction, the fitted values are \\[ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{c} n_j \\hat{\\mu}_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{c} n_j \\bar{y}_j = \\bar{y} \\] and \\[ \\hat{\\tau}_j = \\hat{\\mu}_j - \\hat{\\mu} = \\bar{y}_j - \\bar{y}. \\] 4.4 Combining Categorical and Continuous Explanatory Variables There are several ways to combine categorical and continuous explanatory variables. We initially present the case of only one categorical and one continuous variable. We then briefly present the general case, called the general linear model. When combining categorical and continuous variable models, we use the terminology factor for the categorical variable and covariate for the continuous variable. Combining a Factor and Covariate Let us begin with the simplest models that use a factor and a covariate. In Section 4.3, we introduced the one factor model \\(y_{ij} = \\mu_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\). In Chapter 2, we introduced basic linear regression in terms of one continuous variable, or covariate, using \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\). Table 4.8 summarizes different approaches that could be used to represent combinations of a factor and covariate. Table 4.8: Several Models that Represent Combinations of One Factor and One Covariate Model Description Notation One factor ANOVA (no covariate model) \\(y_{ij} = \\mu_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) Regression with constant intercept and slope (no factor model) \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) Regression with variable intercept and constant slope (analysis of covariance model) \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_1 x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) Regression with constant intercept and variable slope \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1j} x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) Regression with variable intercept and slope \\(y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j} x_{ij} + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\) We can interpret the regression with variable intercept and constant slope to be an additive model, because we are adding the factor effect, \\(\\beta_{0j}\\), to the covariate effect, \\(\\beta_1 x_{ij}\\). Note that one could also use the notation, \\(\\mu_j\\), in lieu of \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) to suggest the presence of a factor effect. This is also known as an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The regression with variable intercept and slope can be thought of as an interaction model. Here, both the intercept, \\(\\beta_{0j}\\), and slope, \\(\\beta_{1j}\\), may vary by level of the factor. In this sense, we interpret the factor and covariate to be “interacting.” The model with constant intercept and variable slope is typically not used in practice; it is included here for completeness. With this model, the factor and covariate interact only through the variable slope. Figures 4.3, 4.4, and 4.5 illustrate the expected responses of these models. Figure 4.3: Plot of the expected response versus the covariate for the regression model with variable intercept and constant slope. Figure 4.4: Plot of the expected response versus the covariate for the regression model with constant intercept and variable slope. Figure 4.5: Plot of the expected response versus the covariate for the regression model with variable intercept and variable slope. For each model presented in Table 4.8, parameter estimates can be calculated using the method of least squares. As usual, this means writing the expected response, \\(E[y_{ij}]\\), as a function of known variables and unknown parameters. For the regression model with variable intercept and constant slope, the least squares estimates can be expressed compactly as: \\[ b_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j) (y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_j)}{\\sum_{j=1}^{c}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j)^2} \\] and \\(b_{0j} = \\bar{y}_j - b_1 \\bar{x}_j\\). Similarly, the least squares estimates for the regression model with variable intercept and slope can be expressed as: \\[ b_{1j} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j) (y_{ij} - \\bar{y}_j)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j)^2} \\] and \\(b_{0j} = \\bar{y}_j - b_{1j} \\bar{x}_j\\). With these parameter estimates, fitted values may be calculated. For each model, fitted values are defined to be the expected response with the unknown parameters replaced by their least squares estimates. For example, for the regression model with variable intercept and constant slope the fitted values are \\(\\hat{y}_{ij} = b_{0j} + b_1 x_{ij}.\\) Example: Wisconsin Hospital Costs. We now study the impact of various predictors on hospital charges in the state of Wisconsin. Identifying predictors of hospital charges can provide direction for hospitals, government, insurers, and consumers in controlling these variables, which in turn leads to better control of hospital costs. The data for the year 1989 were obtained from the Office of Health Care Information, Wisconsin’s Department of Health and Human Services. Cross-sectional data are used, which detail the 20 diagnosis-related group (DRG) discharge costs for hospitals in the state of Wisconsin, broken down into nine major health service areas and three types of payer (Fee for service, HMO, and other). Even though there are 540 potential DRG, area, and payer combinations (\\(20 \\times 9 \\times 3 = 540\\)), only 526 combinations were actually realized in the 1989 data set. Other predictor variables included the logarithm of the total number of discharges (NO DSCHG) and total number of hospital beds (NUM BEDS) for each combination. The response variable is the logarithm of total hospital charges per number of discharges (CHGNUM). To streamline the presentation, we now consider only costs associated with three diagnostic related groups (DRGs): DRG #209, DRG #391, and DRG #430. The covariate, \\(x\\), is the natural logarithm of the number of discharges. In ideal settings, hospitals with more patients enjoy lower costs due to economies of scale. In non-ideal settings, hospitals may not have excess capacity and thus, hospitals with more patients have higher costs. One purpose of this analysis is to investigate the relationship between hospital costs and hospital utilization. Recall that our measure of hospital charges is the logarithm of costs per discharge (\\(y\\)). The scatter plot in Figure 4.6 gives a preliminary idea of the relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). We note that there appears to be a negative relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\). The negative relationship between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) suggested by Figure 4.6 is misleading and is induced by an omitted variable, the category of the cost (DRG). To see the joint effect of the categorical variable DRG and the continuous variable \\(x\\), in Figure 4.7 is a plot of \\(y\\) versus \\(x\\) where the plotting symbols are codes for the level of the categorical variable. From this plot, we see that the level of cost varies by level of the factor DRG. Moreover, for each level of DRG, the slope between \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) is either zero or positive. The slopes are not negative, as suggested by Figure 4.6. Figure 4.6: Plot of natural logarithm of cost per discharge versus natural logarithm of the number of discharges. This plot suggests a misleading negative relationship. Figure 4.7: Letter plot of natural logarithm of cost per discharge versus natural logarithm of the number of discharges by DRG. Here, A is for DRG #209, B is for DRG #391, and C is for DRG #430. Table 4.9: Wisconsin Hospital Cost Models Goodness of Fit Model Description Model degrees of freedom Error degrees of freedom Error Sum of Squares R-squared (%) Mean Square One factor ANOVA 2 76 9.396 93.3 0.124 Regression with constant intercept and slope 1 77 115.059 18.2 1.222 Regression with variable intercept and constant slope 3 75 7.482 94.7 0.100 Regression with constant intercept and variable slope 3 75 14.048 90.0 0.187 Regression with variable intercept and slope 5 73 5.458 96.1 0.075 Each of the five models defined in Table 4.8 was fit to this subset of the Hospital case study. The summary statistics are in Table 4.9. For this data set, there are \\(n = 79\\) observations and \\(c = 3\\) levels of the DRG factor. For each model, the model degrees of freedom is the number of model parameters minus one. The error degrees of freedom is the number of observations minus the number of model parameters. Using binary variables, each of the models in Table 4.8 can be written in a regression format. As we have seen in Section 4.2, when a model can be written as a subset of another, larger model, we have formal testing procedures available to decide which model is more appropriate. To illustrate this testing procedure with our DRG example, from Table 4.9 and the associated plots, it seems clear that the DRG factor is important. Further, a \\(t\\)-test, not presented here, shows that the covariate \\(x\\) is important. Thus, let’s compare the full model \\(E[y_{ij}] = \\beta_{0,j} + \\beta_{1,j}x\\) to the reduced model \\(E[y_{ij}] = \\beta_{0,j} + \\beta_1x\\). In other words, is there a different slope for each DRG? Using the notation from Section 4.2, we call the variable intercept and slope the full model. Under the null hypothesis, \\(H_0: \\beta_{1,1} = \\beta_{1,2} = \\beta_{1,3}\\), we get the variable intercept, constant slope model. Thus, using the \\(F\\)-ratio in equation (4.2), we have \\[ F\\text{-ratio} = \\frac{(Error~SS)_{reduced} - (Error~SS)_{full}}{ps_{full}^2} = \\frac{7.482 - 5.458}{2 \\times 0.075} = 13.535. \\] The 95th percentile from the \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = p = 2\\) and \\(df_2 = (df)_{full} = 73\\) is approximately 3.13. Thus, this test leads us to reject the null hypothesis and declare the alternative, the regression model with variable intercept and variable slope, to be valid. Combining Two Factors We have seen how to combine covariates as well as a covariate and factor, both additively and with interactions. In the same fashion, suppose that we have two factors, say sex (two levels, male/female) and age (three levels, young/middle/old). Let the corresponding binary variables be \\(x_1\\) to indicate whether the observation represents a female, \\(x_2\\) to indicate whether the observation represents a young person, and \\(x_3\\) to indicate whether the observation represents a middle-aged person. An additive model for these two factors may use the regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E }~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3. \\] As we have seen, this model is simple to interpret. For example, we can interpret \\(\\beta_1\\) to be the sex effect, holding age constant. We can also incorporate two interaction terms, \\(x_1 x_2\\) and \\(x_1 x_3\\). Using all five explanatory variables yields the regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E }~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \\beta_5 x_1 x_3. \\tag{4.12} \\] Here, the variables \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_3\\) are known as the main effects. Table 4.10 helps interpret this equation. Specifically, there are six types of people that we could encounter: males and females who are young, middle-aged, or old. We have six parameters in equation (4.12). Table 4.10 provides the link between the parameters and the types of people. By using the interaction terms, we do not impose any prior specifications on the additive effects of each factor. From Table 4.10, we see that the interpretation of the regression coefficients in equation (4.12) is not straightforward. However, using the additive model with interaction terms is equivalent to creating a new categorical variable with six levels, one for each type of person. If the interaction terms are critical in your study, you may wish to create a new factor that incorporates the interaction terms simply for ease of interpretation. Table 4.10: Regression Function for a Two Factor Model with Interactions Sex Age \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\(x_3\\) \\(x_4\\) \\(x_5\\) Regression Function Male Young 0 1 0 0 0 \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_2\\) Male Middle 0 0 1 0 0 \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_3\\) Male Old 0 0 0 0 0 \\(\\beta_0\\) Female Young 1 1 0 1 0 \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 + \\beta_4\\) Female Middle 1 0 1 0 1 \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 + \\beta_5\\) Female Old 1 0 0 0 0 \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\) Extensions to more than two factors follow in a similar fashion. For example, suppose that you are examining the behavior of firms with headquarters in ten geographic regions, two organizational structures (profit versus non-profit) with four years of data. If you decide to treat each variable as a factor and want to model all interaction terms, then this is equivalent to a factor with \\(10 \\times 2 \\times 4 = 80\\) levels. Models with interaction terms can have a substantial number of parameters and the analyst must be prudent when specifying interactions to be considered. General Linear Model The general linear model extends the linear regression model in two ways. First, explanatory variables may be continuous, categorical, or a combination. The only restriction is that they enter linearly such that the resulting regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k \\tag{4.13} \\] is a linear combination of coefficients. As we have seen, we can square continuous variables or take other nonlinear transforms (such as logarithms) as well as use binary variables to represent categorical variables, so this “restriction,” as the name suggests, allows for a broad class of general functions to represent data. The second extension is that the explanatory variables may be linear combinations of one another in the general linear model. Because of this, in the general linear model case, the parameter estimates need not be unique. However, an important feature of the general linear model is that the resulting fitted values turn out to be unique, using the method of least squares. For example, in Section 4.3 we saw that the one factor ANOVA model could be expressed as a regression model with \\(c\\) indicator variables. However, if we had attempted to estimate the model in equation (4.10), the method of least squares would not have arrived at a unique set of regression coefficient estimates. The reason is that, in equation (4.10), each explanatory variable can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. For example, observe that \\(x_c = 1 - (x_1 + x_2 + \\ldots + x_{c-1})\\). The fact that parameter estimates are not unique is a drawback, but not an overwhelming one. The assumption that the explanatory variables are not linear combinations of one another means that we can compute unique estimates of the regression coefficients using the method of least squares. In terms of matrices, because the explanatory variables are not linear combinations of one another, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\) is not invertible. Specifically, suppose that we are considering the regression function in equation (4.13) and, using the method of least squares, our regression coefficient estimates are \\(b_0^{o}, b_1^{o}, \\ldots, b_k^{o}\\). This set of regression coefficient estimates minimizes our error sum of squares, but there may be other sets of coefficients that also minimize the error sum of squares. The fitted values are computed as \\(\\hat{y}_i = b_0^{o} + b_1^{o} x_{i1} + \\ldots + b_k^{o} x_{ik}\\). It can be shown that the resulting fitted values are unique, in the sense that any set of coefficients that minimize the error sum of squares produce the same fitted values (see Section 4.7.3). Thus, for a set of data and a specified general linear model, fitted values are unique. Because residuals are computed as observed responses minus fitted values, we have that the residuals are unique. Because residuals are unique, we have the error sums of squares are unique. Thus, it seems reasonable, and is true, that we can use the general test of hypotheses described in Section 4.2 to decide whether collections of explanatory variables are important. To summarize, for general linear models, parameter estimates may not be unique and thus not meaningful. An important part of regression models is the interpretation of regression coefficients. This interpretation is not necessarily available in the general linear model context. However, for general linear models, we may still discuss the importance of an individual variable or collection of variables through partial F-tests. Further, fitted values, and the corresponding exercise of prediction, works in the general linear model context. The advantage of the general linear model context is that we need not worry about the type of restrictions to impose on the parameters. Although not the subject of this text, this advantage is particularly important in complicated experimental designs used in the life sciences. The reader will find that general linear model estimation routines are widely available in statistical software packages available on the market today. 4.5 Further Reading and References There are several good linear model books that focus on categorical variables and analysis of variable techniques.

In this exercise, we consider relating two statistics that summarize how well a regression model fits, the \\(F\\)-ratio and \\(R^2\\), the coefficient of determination. (Here, the \\(F\\)-ratio is the statistic used to test model adequacy, not a partial \\(F\\) statistic.) Write down \\(R^2\\) in terms of \\(Error ~SS\\) and \\(Regression ~SS\\). Write down \\(F\\)-ratio in terms of \\(Error ~SS\\), \\(Regression ~SS\\), \\(k\\), and \\(n\\). Establish the algebraic relationship \\[ F\\text{-ratio} = \\frac{R^2}{1-R^2} \\frac{n-(k+1)}{k}. \\] Suppose that \\(n = 40\\), \\(k = 5\\), and \\(R^2 = 0.20\\). Calculate the \\(F\\)-ratio. Perform the usual test of model adequacy to determine whether or not the five explanatory variables jointly significantly affect the response variable. Suppose that \\(n = 400\\) (not 40), \\(k = 5\\), and \\(R^2 = 0.20\\). Calculate the \\(F\\)-ratio. Perform the usual test of model adequacy to determine whether or not the five explanatory variables jointly significantly affect the response variable. 4.2. Hospital Costs. This exercise considers hospital expenditures data provided by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and described in Exercise 1.4. Produce a scatter plot, correlation, and a linear regression of \\(LNTOTCHG\\) on \\(AGE\\). Is \\(AGE\\) a significant predictor of \\(LNTOTCHG\\)? You are concerned that newborns follow a different pattern than other ages. Create a binary variable that indicates whether or not \\(AGE\\) equals zero. Run a regression using this binary variable and \\(AGE\\) as explanatory variables. Is the binary variable statistically significant? Now examine the gender effect, using the binary variable \\(FEMALE\\) that is one if the patient is female and zero otherwise. Run a regression using \\(AGE\\) and \\(FEMALE\\) as explanatory variables. Run a second regression including these two variables with an interaction term. Comment on whether the gender effect is important in either model. Now consider the type of admission, \\(APRDRG\\), an acronym for “all patient refined diagnostic related group.” This is a categorical explanatory variable that provides information on the type of hospital admission. There are several hundred levels of this category. For example, level 640 represents admission for a normal newborn, with neonatal weight greater than or equal to 2.5 kilograms. As another example, level 225 represents admission resulting in an appendectomy. d(i). Run a one-factor ANOVA model, using \\(APRDRG\\) to predict \\(LNTOTCHG\\). Examine the \\(R^2\\) from this model and compare it to the coefficient of determination of the linear regression model of \\(LNTOTCHG\\) on \\(AGE\\). Based on this comparison, which model do you think is preferred? d(ii). For the one-factor model in part d(i), provide a 95% confidence interval for the mean of \\(LNTOTCHG\\) for level 225 corresponding to an appendectomy. Convert your final answer from logarithmic dollars to dollars via exponentiation. d(iii). Run a regression model of \\(APRDRG\\), \\(FEMALE\\), and \\(AGE\\) on \\(LNTOTCHG\\). State whether \\(AGE\\) is a statistically significant predictor of \\(LNTOTCHG\\). State whether \\(FEMALE\\) is a statistically significant predictor of \\(LNTOTCHG\\). 4.3. Nursing Home Utilization. This exercise considers nursing home data provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health and Family Services (DHFS) and described in Exercises 1.2, 2.10, and 2.20. In addition to the size variables, we also have information on several binary variables. The variable \\(URBAN\\) is used to indicate the facility’s location. It is one if the facility is located in an urban environment and zero otherwise. The variable \\(MCERT\\) indicates whether the facility is Medicare-certified. Most, but not all, nursing homes are certified to provide Medicare-funded care. There are three organizational structures for nursing homes. They are government (state, counties, municipalities), for-profit businesses, and tax-exempt organizations. Periodically, facilities may change ownership and, less frequently, ownership type. We create two binary variables \\(PRO\\) and \\(TAXEXEMPT\\) to denote for-profit business and tax-exempt organizations, respectively. Some nursing homes opt not to purchase private insurance coverage for their employees. Instead, these facilities directly provide insurance and pension benefits to their employees; this is referred to as “self funding of insurance.” We use binary variable \\(SELFFUNDINS\\) to denote it. You decide to examine the relationship between \\(LOGTPY(y)\\) and the explanatory variables. Use cost report year 2001 data, and do the following analysis. There are three levels of organizational structures, but we only use two binary variables (\\(PRO\\) and \\(TAXEXEMPT\\)). Explain why. Run a one-way analysis of variance using \\(TAXEXEMPT\\) as the factor. Decide whether or not tax-exempt is an important factor in determining \\(LOGTPY\\). State your null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, and all components of the decision-making rule. Use a 5% level of significance. Run a one-way analysis of variance using \\(MCERT\\) as the factor. Decide whether or not \\(MCERT\\) is an important factor in determining \\(LOGTPY\\). c(i). Provide a point estimate of \\(LOGTPY\\) for a nursing facility that is not Medicare-Certified. c(ii). Provide a 95% confidence interval for your point estimate in part (i). Run a regression model using the binary variables, \\(URBAN\\), \\(PRO\\), \\(TAXEXEMPT\\), \\(SELFFUNDINS\\), and \\(MCERT\\). Find \\(R^2\\). Which variables are statistically significant? Run a regression model using all explanatory variables, \\(LOGNUMBED\\), \\(LOGSQRFOOT\\), \\(URBAN\\), \\(PRO\\), \\(TAXEXEMPT\\), \\(SELFFUNDINS\\), and \\(MCERT\\). Find \\(R^2\\). Which variables are statistically significant? e(i). Calculate the partial correlation between \\(LOGTPY\\) and \\(LOGSQRFOOT\\). Compare this to the correlation between \\(LOGTPY\\) and \\(LOGSQRFOOT\\). Explain why the partial correlation is small. e(ii). Compare the low level of the \\(t\\)-ratios (for testing the importance of individual regression coefficients) and the high level of the \\(F\\)-ratio (for testing model adequacy). Describe the seeming inconsistency and provide an explanation for this inconsistency. 4.4. Automobile Insurance Claims. Refer to Exercise 1.3. Run a regression of \\(LNPAID\\) on \\(AGE\\). Is \\(AGE\\) a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rule. Also comment on the goodness of fit of this variable. Consider using class as a single explanatory variable. Use the one factor to estimate the model and respond to the following questions. b(i). What is the point estimate of claims in class C7, drivers 50-69, driving to work or school, less than 30 miles per week with annual mileage under 7500, in natural logarithmic units? b(ii). Determine the corresponding 95% confidence interval of expected claims, in natural logarithmic units. b(iii). Convert the 95% confidence interval of expected claims that you determined in part b(ii) to dollars. Run a regression of \\(LNPAID\\) on \\(AGE\\), \\(GENDER\\), and the categorical variables \\(STATE\\ CODE\\) and \\(CLASS\\). c(i). Is \\(GENDER\\) a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rule. c(ii). Is \\(CLASS\\) a statistically significant variable? To respond to this question, use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rule. c(iii). Use the model to provide a point estimate of claims in dollars (not log dollars) for a male age 60 in STATE 2 in CLASS C7. c(iv). Write down the coefficient associated with CLASS C7 and interpret this coefficient. 4.5. Wisconsin Lottery Sales. This exercise considers State of Wisconsin lottery sales data that were described in Section 2.1 and examined in Exercise 3.4. Part 1: You decide to examine the relationship between SALES (\\(y\\)) and all eight explanatory variables (\\(PERPERHH\\), \\(MEDSCHYR\\), \\(MEDHVL\\), \\(PRCRENT\\), \\(PRC55P\\), \\(HHMEDAGE\\), \\(MEDINC\\), and \\(POP\\)). Fit a regression model of SALES on all eight explanatory variables. Find \\(R^2\\). b(i). Use it to calculate the correlation coefficient between the observed and fitted values. b(ii). You want to use \\(R^2\\) to test the adequacy of the model in part (a). Use a formal test of hypothesis. State your null and alternative hypothesis, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. Test whether \\(POP\\), \\(MEDSCHYR\\), and \\(MEDHVL\\) are jointly important explanatory variables for understanding SALES. Part 2: After the preliminary analysis in Part 1, you decide to examine the relationship between SALES (\\(y\\)) and \\(POP\\), \\(MEDSCHYR\\), and \\(MEDHVL\\). Fit a regression model of SALES on these three explanatory variables. Has the coefficient of determination decreased from the eight-variable regression model to the three-variable model? Does this mean that the model is not improved or does it provide little information? Explain your response. To state formally whether one should use the three or eight variable model, use a partial \\(F\\)-test. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. 4.6. Insurance Company Expenses. This exercise considers insurance company data from the NAIC and described in Exercises 1.6 and 3.5. Are the quadratic terms important? Consider a linear model of \\(LNEXPENSES\\) on twelve explanatory variables. For the explanatory variables, include \\(ASSETS\\), \\(GROUP\\), both versions of losses and gross premiums, as well as the two BLS variables. Also include the square of each of the two loss and the two gross premium variables. Test whether the four squared terms are jointly statistically significant, using a partial \\(F\\)-test. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. Are the interaction terms with \\(GROUP\\) important? Omit the two BLS variables, so that now there are eleven variables: \\(ASSETS\\), \\(GROUP\\), both versions of losses and gross premiums, as well as interactions of \\(GROUP\\) with \\(ASSETS\\) and both versions of losses and gross premiums. Test whether the five interaction terms are jointly statistically significant, using a partial \\(F\\)-test. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. You are examining a company that is not in the sample with values \\(LONGLOSS = 0.025\\), \\(SHORTLOSS = 0.040\\), \\(GPWPERSONAL = 0.050\\), \\(GPWCOMM = 0.120\\), \\(ASSETS = 0.400\\), \\(CASH = 0.350\\), and \\(GROUP = 1\\). Use the eleven variable interaction model in part (b) to produce a 95% prediction interval for this company. 4.7. National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercises 1.7, 2.22, and 3.6. Consider the regression using three explanatory variables, \\(FERTILITY\\), \\(PUBLICEDUCATION\\), and \\(\\ln{HEALTH}\\) that you did in Exercise 3.6. Test whether \\(PUBLICEDUCATION\\) and \\(\\ln{HEALTH}\\) are jointly statistically significant, using a partial \\(F\\)-test. State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. (Hint: Use the coefficient of determination form for calculating the test statistic.) Provide an approximate \\(p\\)-value for the test. We now introduce the \\(REGION\\) variable, summarized in Table 4.11. A boxplot of life expectancies versus \\(REGION\\) is given in Figure 4.8. Describe what we learn from the Table and boxplot about the effect of \\(REGION\\) on \\(LIFEEXP\\). Figure 4.8: Boxplots of LIFEEXP by REGION Table 4.11 summarizes average life expectancy by region. REGION Region Description Number Mean 1 Arab States 13 71.9 2 East Asia and the Pacific 17 69.1 3 Latin American and the Carribean 25 72.8 4 South Asia 7 65.1 5 Southern Europe 3 67.4 6 Sub-Saharan Africa 38 52.2 7 Central and Eastern Europe 24 71.6 8 High Income OECD 23 79.6 All 150 67.4 Fit a regression model using only the factor, \\(REGION\\). Is \\(REGION\\) a statistically significant determinant of \\(LIFEEXP\\)? State your null and alternative hypotheses, decision-making criterion, and your decision-making rules. Fit a regression model using three explanatory variables, \\(FERTILITY\\), \\(PUBLICEDUCATION\\), and \\(\\ln{HEALTH}\\), as well as the categorical variable \\(REGION\\). d(i). You are examining a country not in the sample with values \\(FERTILITY = 2.0\\), \\(PUBLICEDUCATION = 5.0\\), and \\(\\ln{HEALTH} = 1.0\\). Produce two predicted life expectancy values by assuming that the country is from (1) an Arab state and (2) Sub-Saharan Africa. d(ii). Provide a 95% confidence interval for the difference in life expectancies between an Arab state and a country from Sub-Saharan Africa. d(iii). Provide the (usual ordinary least squares) point estimate for the difference in life expectancies between a country from Sub-Saharan Africa and a high-income OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) country. 4.7 Technical Supplement - Matrix Expressions 4.7.1 Expressing Models with Categorical Variables in Matrix Form Chapter 3 showed how to write the regression model equation in the form \\(\\mathbf{y = X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is a matrix of explanatory variables. This form permits straightforward calculation of regression coefficients, \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\). This section shows how the model and calculations reduce to simpler expressions when the explanatory variables are categorical. One Categorical Variable Model. Consider the model with one categorical variable introduced in Section 4.3 with \\(c\\) levels of the categorical variable. From equation (4.9), this model can be written as \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} y_{1,1} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ y_{n_1,1} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ y_{1,c} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ y_{n_{c},c} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdots \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_1 \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\mu_c \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} \\varepsilon_{1,1} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\varepsilon_{n_1,1} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\varepsilon_{1,c} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\varepsilon_{n_{c},c} \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\] To make the notation more compact, we write \\(\\mathbf{0}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{1}\\) for a column of zeros and ones, respectively. With this convention, another way to express this as \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu_1 \\\\ \\mu_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mu_c \\end{bmatrix} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\tag{4.14} \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{0}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{1}_1\\) stand for vector columns of length \\(n_1\\) of zeros and ones, respectively, and similarly for \\(\\mathbf{0}_2, \\mathbf{1}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{0}_c, \\mathbf{1}_c\\). Equation (4.14) allows us to apply the machinery developed for the regression model to the model with one categorical variable. As an intermediate calculation, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} &amp;= \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix}^{\\prime} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix} \\right)^{-1}\\\\ &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; n_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; n_c \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{n_1} &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{1}{n_2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{1}{n_c} \\end{bmatrix} . \\tag{4.15} \\end{array} \\] Thus, the parameter estimates are \\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\hat{\\mu}_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\hat{\\mu}_c \\end{bmatrix} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{n_1} &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{1}{n_2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{1}{n_c} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix}^{\\prime} \\begin{bmatrix} y_{1,1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{n_1,1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{1,c} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{n_{c},c} \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{n_1} &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{1}{n_2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\frac{1}{n_c} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} y_{i1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n_c} y_{ic} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\bar{y}_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\bar{y}_c \\end{bmatrix} \\tag{4.16} \\] We have seen that the least squares estimate of \\(\\mu_j\\), \\(\\bar{y}_j\\), can been obtained directly from equation (4.9). By rewriting the model in matrix regression notation, we can appeal to linear regression model results and need not prove properties of models with categorical variables from first principles. That is, because this model is in regression format, we immediately have all the properties of the regression model. Telling your software package that a variable is categorical can mean more efficient calculations, as in the calculations of the least squares regression estimates in equation (4.16). Further, calculation of other quantities can also be done more directly. As another example, we have that the standard error of \\(\\hat{\\mu}_j\\) is \\[ se(\\hat{\\mu}_j) = s ~ \\sqrt{j \\text{th} \\textit{ diagonal element of } \\mathbf{(X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X)}^{-1}} = s/\\sqrt{n_j}. \\] One Categorical and One Continuous Variable Model As another illustration, we consider the variable intercept and constant slope model. This model is summarized as \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\\) where \\[ \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{x}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{x}_2 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_{c} &amp; \\mathbf{0}_{c} &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c &amp; \\mathbf{x}_{c} \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\begin{bmatrix} \\beta_{01} \\\\ \\beta_{02} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\beta_{0c} \\\\ \\beta_1 \\end{bmatrix}. \\tag{4.17} \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{0}_j\\) and \\(\\mathbf{1}_j\\) stand for vector columns of length \\(n_j\\) of zeros and ones, respectively, and \\(\\mathbf{x}_j = (x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{n_j, j})^{\\prime}\\) is the column of the continuous variable at the \\(j\\)th level. Straightforward matrix algebra techniques provide the least squares estimates. 4.7.2 Calculating Least Squares Recursively When computing regression coefficients using least squares, \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\), for some applications, the dimension of \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\) can be large, causing computational difficulties. Fortunately, for some problems, the computations can be partitioned into smaller problems that can be solved recursively. Recursive Least Squares Calculation. Suppose that the regression function can be written as \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\left( \\mathbf{X}_1 : \\mathbf{X}_2 \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 \\\\ \\boldsymbol \\beta_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right), \\tag{4.18} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) has dimensions \\(n \\times k_1\\), \\(\\mathbf{X}_2\\) has dimensions \\(n \\times k_2\\), \\(k_1 + k_2 = k\\), \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_1\\) has dimensions \\(k_1 \\times 1\\), and \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_2\\) has dimensions \\(k_2 \\times 1\\). Define \\(\\mathbf{Q}_1 = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{X}_1 \\left(\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\). Then, the least squares estimator can be computed as: \\[ \\mathbf{b} = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{b}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 \\right) \\\\ \\left(\\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right). \\tag{4.19} \\] Equation (4.19) provides the first step in the recursion. It can easily be iterated to allow for a more detailed decomposition of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Special Case: One Categorical and One Continuous Variable Model. To illustrate the relevance of equation (4.19), consider the model summarized in equation (4.17). Here, the dimension of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) is \\(n \\times (c+1)\\) and so the dimension of \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\) is \\((c+1) \\times (c+1)\\). Taking the inverse of this matrix could be difficult if \\(c\\) is large. To apply equation (4.19), we define \\[ \\mathbf{X}_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\cdot \\cdot \\cdot &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix} \\text{ and } \\mathbf{X}_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{x}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_2 \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_c \\end{bmatrix}. \\] In this case, we have seen in equation (4.15) how it is straightforward to compute \\(\\left(\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1\\right)^{-1}\\) without requiring matrix inversion. This makes calculating \\(\\mathbf{Q}_1\\) straightforward. With this, we can compute \\(\\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2\\) and, because it is a scalar, immediately get its inverse. This provides \\(\\mathbf{b}_2\\) which is then used to calculate \\(\\mathbf{b}_1\\). Although this procedure is not as direct as \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\left(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\), it can be computationally efficient. Partitioned Matrix Results To establish equation (4.19), we use results standard in matrix algebra regarding the inverses of partitioned matrices. Partitioned Matrix Results. Suppose that we can partition the \\((p+q) \\times (p+q)\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) as \\[ \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{B}_{11} &amp; \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\\\ \\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime} &amp; \\mathbf{B}_{22} \\end{bmatrix}, \\] where \\(\\mathbf{B}_{11}\\) is a \\(p \\times p\\) invertible matrix, \\(\\mathbf{B}_{22}\\) is a \\(q \\times q\\) invertible matrix, and \\(\\mathbf{B}_{12}\\) is a \\(p \\times q\\) matrix. Then \\[ \\mathbf{B}^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{C}_{11}^{-1} &amp; - \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\\\ - \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} &amp; \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\end{bmatrix}, \\tag{4.20} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{C}_{11} = \\mathbf{B}_{11} - \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{B}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{C}_{22} = \\mathbf{B}_{22} - \\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12}.\\) To verify equation (4.20), multiply \\(\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\) by \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) to obtain the identity matrix \\(\\mathbf{I}\\). Further, \\[ \\mathbf{C}_{11}^{-1} = \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}. \\tag{4.21} \\] Now, we first write the least squares estimator as \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{b} &amp;= \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} = \\left( \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}_1 : \\mathbf{X}_2 \\right)\\right)^{-1} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right) \\mathbf{y} \\\\ &amp; = \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_2 \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{b}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right). \\end{array} \\] To apply the partitioned matrix results, we define \\[ \\mathbf{Q}_j = \\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{X}_j \\left(\\mathbf{X}_j^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_j \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_j^{\\prime}, \\] \\(j=1,2,\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}_{j,k} = \\mathbf{X}_j^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_k\\) for \\(j,k=1,2.\\) This means that \\(\\mathbf{C}_{11}=\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1 - \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_2 (\\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_2)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime }\\) \\(= \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_2 \\mathbf{X}_1\\) and similarly \\(\\mathbf{C}_{22} = \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2\\). From the second row, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{b}_2 &amp;= \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\left( -\\mathbf{B}_{12}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\left(\\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2 \\right)^{-1} \\left( - \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\left(\\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1 \\mathbf{X}_2 \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Q}_1\\mathbf{y}. \\end{array} \\] From the first row, \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{b}_1 &amp;= \\mathbf{C}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}_{12}\\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\\\ &amp;= \\left( \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{21} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\right) \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}\\mathbf{B}_{12}\\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{C}_{22}^{-1} \\left( -\\mathbf{B}_{21} \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{X}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\right)\\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{B}_{11}^{-1} \\mathbf{B}_{12} \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\ &amp;= (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 \\\\ &amp;= (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}_2 \\mathbf{b}_2 \\right). \\end{array} \\] This establishes equation (4.19). Reparameterized Model. For the partitioned regression function in equation (4.18), define \\(\\mathbf{A}= \\left( \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_2\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}_2 = \\mathbf{X}_2 - \\mathbf{X}_1 \\mathbf{A}\\). If one were to run a “multivariate” regression using \\(\\mathbf{X}_2\\) as the response and \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) as explanatory variables, then the parameter estimates would be \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and the residuals \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\). With these definitions, use equation (4.18) to define the reparameterized regression model \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{y} &amp; = \\mathbf{X}_1 \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 + \\mathbf{X}_2 \\boldsymbol \\beta_2 + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\mathbf{X}_1 \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 + (\\mathbf{E}_2 + \\mathbf{X}_1 \\mathbf{A})\\boldsymbol \\beta_2 + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon \\\\ &amp; = \\mathbf{X}_1 \\boldsymbol \\alpha_1 + \\mathbf{E}_2 \\boldsymbol \\beta_2 + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon, \\end{array} \\tag{4.22} \\] where \\(\\boldsymbol \\alpha_1 = \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 + \\mathbf{A}\\boldsymbol \\beta_2\\) is a new vector of parameters. The reason for introducing this new parameterization is that now the vector of explanatory variables is orthogonal to the other explanatory variables, that is, straightforward algebra shows that \\(\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_2=\\mathbf{0}\\). By equation (4.19), the vector of least squares estimates is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{a} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{b}_2 \\end{bmatrix} = \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{E}_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) ^{-1} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\left( \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{ \\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{E}_2\\right) ^{-1} \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{array} \\tag{4.23} \\] Extra Sum of Squares. Suppose that we wish to consider the increase in the error sum of squares going from a reduced model \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}_1 \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon \\] to a full model \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}_1 \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 + \\mathbf{X}_2 \\boldsymbol \\beta_2 + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon. \\] For the reduced model, the error sum of squares is \\[ (Error ~SS)_{reduced} = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{4.24} \\] Using the reparameterized version of the full model, the error sum of squares is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} (Error ~SS)_{full} &amp;= \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{a}^{\\prime} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\end{bmatrix} \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - \\begin{bmatrix} \\left( \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{E}_2\\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\end{bmatrix}^{\\prime} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 (\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 (\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)^{-1} \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{4.25} \\end{array} \\] Thus, the reduction in the error sum of squares by adding \\(\\mathbf{X}_2\\) to the model is \\[ (Error ~SS)_{reduced} - (Error ~SS)_{full} = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 (\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)^{-1} \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{4.26} \\] As noted in Section 4.3, the quantity \\((Error ~SS)_{reduced} - (Error ~SS)_{full}\\) is called the extra sum of squares, or Type III sum of squares. It is produced automatically by some statistical software packages, thus obviating the need to run separate regressions. 4.7.3 General Linear Model Recall the general linear model from Section 4.4. That is, we use \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 x_{i0} + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\varepsilon_i, \\] or, in matrix notation, \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon\\). As before, we use Assumptions F1-F4 (or E1-E4) so that the disturbance terms are i.i.d. with mean zero and common variance \\(\\sigma^2\\), and the explanatory variables \\(\\{x_{i0},x_{i1},x_{i2},\\ldots,x_{ik}\\}\\) are non-stochastic. In the general linear model, we do not require that \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\) be invertible. As we have seen in Chapter 4, an important reason for this generalization relates to handling categorical variables. That is, in order to use categorical variables, they are generally re-coded using binary variables. For this re-coding, generally some type of restrictions need to be made on the set of parameters associated with the indicator variables. However, it is not always clear what type of restrictions are the most intuitive. By expressing the model without requiring that \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\) be invertible, the restrictions can be imposed after the estimation is done, not before. Normal Equations. Even when \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}\\) is not invertible, solutions to the normal equations still provide least squares estimates of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). That is, the sum of squares is \\[ SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{(y - Xb}^{\\ast}\\mathbf{)}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{(y - Xb}^{\\ast}\\mathbf{)}, \\] where \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast} = (b_0^{\\ast}, b_1^{\\ast}, \\ldots, b_k^{\\ast})^{\\prime}\\) is a vector of candidate estimates. Solutions of the normal equations are those vectors \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ }\\) that satisfy the normal equations \\[ \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\circ } = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}. \\tag{4.27} \\] We use the notation \\(^{\\circ }\\) to remind ourselves that \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ }\\) need not be unique. However, it is a minimizer of the sum of squares. To see this, consider another candidate vector \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\) and note that \\[ SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} - 2\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\ast}. \\] Then, using equation (4.27), we have \\[ SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}) - SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ }) = -2\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y} + \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\ast} - (-2\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ \\prime }\\mathbf{Xy} + \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\circ }) \\] \\[ = -2\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\circ } + \\mathbf{b}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\ast} + \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Xb}^{\\circ } \\] \\[ = \\mathbf{(b}^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ})^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}) = \\mathbf{z}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{z} \\geq 0, \\] where \\(\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ})\\). Thus, any other candidate \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\ast}\\) yields a sum of squares at least as large as \\(SS(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ})\\). Unique Fitted Values Despite the fact that there may be (infinitely) many solutions to the normal equations, the resulting fitted values, \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{Xb}^{\\circ}\\), are unique. To see this, suppose that \\(\\mathbf{b}_1^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_2^{\\circ}\\) are two different solutions of equation (4.27). Let \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_1 = \\mathbf{Xb}_1^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_2 = \\mathbf{Xb}_2^{\\circ}\\) denote the vectors of fitted values generated by these estimates. Then, \\[ \\mathbf{(\\hat{y}}_1 - \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_2)^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_1 - \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_2) = \\mathbf{(b}_1^{\\circ} - \\mathbf{b}_2^{\\circ})^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{b}_1^{\\circ} - \\mathbf{b}_2^{\\circ}) = 0 \\] because \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{b}_1^{\\circ} - \\mathbf{b}_2^{\\circ}) = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{0}\\), from equation (4.27). Hence we have that \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_1 = \\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_2\\) for any choice of \\(\\mathbf{b}_1^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_2^{\\circ}\\), thus establishing the uniqueness of the fitted values. Because the fitted values are unique, the residuals are also unique. Thus, the error sum of squares and estimates of variability (such as \\(s^2\\)) are also unique. Generalized Inverses A generalized inverse of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{ABA = A}\\). We use the notation \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathbf{-}}\\) to denote the generalized inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In the case that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is invertible, then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathbf{-}}\\) is unique and equals \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathbf{-1}}\\). Although there are several definitions of generalized inverses, the above definition suffices for our purposes. See Searle (1987) for further discussion of alternative definitions of generalized inverses. With this definition, it can be shown that a solution to the equation \\(\\mathbf{Ab = c}\\) can be expressed as \\(\\mathbf{b = A}^{-} \\mathbf{c}\\). Thus, we can express a least squares estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) as \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\). Statistical software packages can calculate versions of \\((\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-}\\) and thus generate \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}\\). Estimable Functions Above, we saw that each fitted value \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) is unique. Because fitted values are simply linear combinations of parameter estimates, it seems reasonable to ask what other linear combinations of parameter estimates are unique. To this end, we say that \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta}\\) is an estimable function of parameters if \\(\\mathbf{Cb}^{\\circ}\\) does not depend (is invariant) on the choice of \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}\\). Because fitted values are invariant to the choice of \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}\\), we have that \\(\\mathbf{C = X}\\) produces one type of estimable function. Interestingly, it turns out that all estimable functions are of the form \\(\\mathbf{LXb}^{\\circ}\\), that is, \\(\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{LX}\\). See Searle (1987, page 284) for a demonstration of this. Thus, all estimable functions are linear combinations of fitted values, that is, \\(\\mathbf{LXb}^{\\circ} = \\mathbf{L\\hat{y}}\\). Estimable functions are unbiased and have a variance that does not depend on the choice of the generalized inverse. That is, it can be shown that \\(\\text{E } \\mathbf{Cb}^{\\circ} = \\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta}\\) and \\(\\text{Var } \\mathbf{Cb}^{\\circ} = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{C(X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-} \\mathbf{C}^{\\prime}\\) does not depend on the choice of \\(\\mathbf{(X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-}\\). Testable Hypotheses As described in Section 4.2, it is often of interest to test \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta} = \\mathbf{d}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is a specified vector. This hypothesis is said to be testable if \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta}\\) is an estimable function, \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is of full row rank, and the rank of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is less than the rank of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). For consistency with the notation of Section 4.2, let \\(p\\) be the rank of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) and \\(k + 1\\) be the rank of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Recall that the rank of a matrix is the smaller of the number of linearly independent rows and linearly independent columns. When we say that \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) has full row rank, we mean that there are \\(p\\) rows in \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), so that the number of rows equals the rank. General Linear Hypothesis As in Section 4.2, the test statistic for examining \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta} = \\mathbf{d}\\) is \\[ F\\text{-ratio} = \\frac{\\mathbf{(Cb}^{\\circ} - \\mathbf{d})^{\\prime} \\mathbf{(C(X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-} \\mathbf{C}^{\\prime})^{-1} \\mathbf{(Cb}^{\\circ} - \\mathbf{d})}{ps_{full}^2}. \\] Note that the statistic \\(F\\)-ratio does not depend on the choice of \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}\\) because \\(\\mathbf{C b}^{\\circ}\\) is invariant to \\(\\mathbf{b}^{\\circ}\\). If \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mathbf{C \\boldsymbol \\beta} = \\mathbf{d}\\) is a testable hypothesis and the errors \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are i.i.d. \\(\\text{N}(0, \\sigma^2)\\), then the \\(F\\)-ratio has an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = p\\) and \\(df_2 = n - (k + 1)\\). One Categorical Variable Model We now illustrate the general linear model by considering an over-parameterized version of the one factor model that appears in equation (4.10) using \\[ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_j + e_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_1 x_{i1} + \\tau_2 x_{i2} + \\ldots + \\tau_c x_{ic} + \\varepsilon_{ij}. \\] At this point, we do not impose additional restrictions in the parameters. As with equation (4.13), this can be written in matrix form as \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_1 \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 &amp; \\mathbf{1}_{\\mathbf{2}} &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{0}_2 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_c &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\mathbf{0}_c &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\mathbf{1}_c \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu \\\\ \\tau_1 \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\tau_c \\end{bmatrix} + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\mathbf{X \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon}. \\] Thus, the \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\) matrix is \\[ \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} = \\begin{bmatrix} n &amp; n_1 &amp; n_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; n_c \\\\ n_1 &amp; n_1 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ n_2 &amp; 0 &amp; n_2 &amp; \\cdots &amp; 0 \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdot &amp; \\cdots &amp; \\cdot \\\\ n_c &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\cdots &amp; n_c \\end{bmatrix}. \\] where \\(n = n_1 + n_2 + \\ldots + n_{c}\\). This matrix is not invertible. To see this, note that by adding the last \\(c\\) rows together yields the first row. Thus, the last \\(c\\) rows are an exact linear combination of the first row, meaning that the matrix is not full rank. The (non-unique) least squares estimates can be expressed as \\[ \\mathbf{b}^{\\circ} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mu^{\\circ} \\\\ \\tau_1^{\\circ} \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot \\\\ \\tau_c^{\\circ} \\end{bmatrix} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\] Estimable functions are linear combinations of fitted values. Because fitted values are \\(\\hat{y}_{ij} = \\bar{y}_j\\), estimable functions can be expressed as \\(L = \\sum_{j=1}^{c} a_j \\bar{y}_j\\) where \\(a_1, \\ldots, a_{c}\\) are constants. This linear combination of fitted values is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\text{E } L = \\sum_{i=1}^{c} a_i (\\mu + \\tau_i)\\). Thus, for example, by choosing \\(a_1 = 1\\) and the other \\(a_i = 0\\), we see that \\(\\mu + \\tau_1\\) is estimable. As another example, by choosing \\(a_1 = 1\\), \\(a_2 = -1\\), and the other \\(a_i = 0\\), we see that \\(\\tau_1 - \\tau_2\\) is estimable. It can be shown that \\(\\mu\\) is not an estimable parameter without further restrictions on \\(\\tau_1, \\ldots, \\tau_c\\).

This chapter describes tools and techniques to help you select variables to enter into a linear regression model, beginning with an iterative model selection process. In applications with many potential explanatory variables, automatic variable selection procedures will help you quickly evaluate many models. Nonetheless, automatic procedures have serious limitations, including the inability to account properly for nonlinearities such as the impact of unusual points; this chapter expands upon the Chapter 2 discussion of unusual points. It also describes collinearity, a common feature of regression data where explanatory variables are linearly related to one another. Other topics that impact variable selection, including heteroscedasticity and out-of-sample validation, are also introduced. 5.1 An Iterative Approach to Data Analysis and Modeling In our introduction of basic linear regression in Chapter 2, we examined the data graphically, hypothesized a model structure, and compared the data to a candidate model to formulate an improved model. Box (1980) describes this as an iterative process, which is shown in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1: The iterative model specification process This iterative process provides a useful recipe for structuring the task of specifying a model to represent a set of data. The first step, the model formulation stage, is accomplished by examining the data graphically and using prior knowledge of relationships, such as from economic theory or standard industry practice. The second step in the iteration is based on the assumptions of the specified model. These assumptions must be consistent with the data to make valid use of the model. The third step, diagnostic checking, is also known as data and model criticism; the data and model must be consistent with one another before additional inferences can be made. Diagnostic checking is an important part of the model formulation; it can reveal mistakes made in previous steps and provide ways to correct these mistakes. 5.2 Automatic Variable Selection Procedures Business and economics relationships are complicated; there are typically many variables that could serve as useful predictors of the dependent variable. In searching for a suitable relationship, there is a large number of potential models that are based on linear combinations of explanatory variables and an infinite number that can be formed from nonlinear combinations. To search among models based on linear combinations, several automatic procedures are available to select variables to be included in the model. These automatic procedures are easy to use and will suggest one or more models that you can explore in further detail. To illustrate how large is the potential number of linear models, suppose that there are only four variables, f\\(x_{1},\\) \\(x_2,\\) \\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\), under consideration for fitting a model to \\(y\\). Without any consideration of multiplication or other nonlinear combinations of explanatory variables, how many possible models are there? Table 5.1 shows that the answer is 16. Table 5.1: Sixteen Possible Models Expression Combinations Models E \\(y=\\beta_0\\) 1 model with no independent variables E \\(y=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_i\\) \\(i\\) = 1,2,3,4 4 models with one independent variable E \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 x_j\\) (\\(i,j\\)) = (1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,3),(2,4),(3,4) 6 models with two independent variables E \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_j +\\beta_3x_{k}\\) (\\(i,j,k\\)) = (1,2,3),(1,2,4),(1,3,4),(2,3,4) 4 models with three independent variables E \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 +\\beta_3 x_3 + \\beta_4 x_4\\) 1 model with all independent variables If there were only three explanatory variables, then you can use the same logic to verify that there are eight possible models. Extrapolating from these two examples, how many linear models will there be if there are ten explanatory variables? The answer is 1,024, which is quite a few. In general, the answer is \\(2^k\\), where \\(k\\) is the number of explanatory variables. For example, \\(2^3\\) is 8, \\(2^4\\) is 16, and so on. In any case, for a moderately large number of explanatory variables, there are many potential models that are based on linear combinations of explanatory variables. We would like a procedure to search quickly through these potential models to give us more time to think about other interesting aspects of model selection. Stepwise regression are procedures that employ \\(t\\)-tests to check the “significance” of explanatory variables entered into, or deleted from, the model. To begin, in the forward selection version of stepwise regression, variables are added one at a time. In the first stage, out of all the candidate variables the one that is most statistically significant is added to the model. At the next stage, with the first stage variable already included, the next most statistically significant variable is added. This procedure is repeated until all statistically significant variables have been added. Here, statistical significance is typically assessed using a variable’s \\(t\\)-ratio – the cut-off for statistical significance is typically a pre-determined \\(t\\)-value (such as two, corresponding to an approximate 95% significance level). The backwards selection version works in a similar manner, except that all variables are included in the initial stage and then are dropped one at a time (instead of added). More generally, an algorithm that adds and deletes variables at each stage is sometimes known as the stepwise regression algorithm. Stepwise Regression Algorithm. Suppose that the analyst has identified one variable as the response, \\(y\\), and \\(k\\) potential explanatory variables, \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k\\). Consider all possible regressions using one explanatory variable. For each of the \\(k\\) regressions, compute \\(t(b_1)\\), the \\(t\\)-ratio for the slope. Choose that variable with the largest \\(t\\)-ratio. If the \\(t\\)-ratio does not exceed a pre-specified \\(t\\)-value (such as two), then do not choose any variables and halt the procedure. Add a variable to the model from the previous step. The variable to enter is the one that makes the largest significant contribution. To determine the size of contribution, use the absolute value of the variable’s \\(t\\)-ratio. To enter, the \\(t\\)-ratio must exceed a specified \\(t\\)-value in absolute value. Delete a variable from the model in the previous step. The variable to be removed is the one that makes the smallest contribution. To determine the size of contribution, use the absolute value of the variable’s \\(t\\)-ratio. To be removed, the \\(t\\)-ratio must be less than a specified \\(t\\)-value in absolute value. Repeat steps (ii) and (iii) until all possible additions and deletions are performed. When implementing this routine, some statistical software packages use an \\(F\\)-test in lieu of \\(t\\)-tests. Recall, when only one variable is being considered, that \\((t\\text{-ratio})^2 = F\\)-ratio and thus these procedures are equivalent. This algorithm is useful in that it quickly searches through a number of candidate models. However, there are several drawbacks: The procedure “snoops” through a large number of models and may fit the data “too well.” There is no guarantee that the selected model is the best. The algorithm does not consider models that are based on nonlinear combinations of explanatory variables. It also ignores the presence of outliers and high leverage points. In addition, the algorithm does not even search all \\(2^{k}\\) possible linear regressions. The algorithm uses one criterion, a \\(t\\)-ratio, and does not consider other criteria such as \\(s\\), \\(R^2\\), \\(R_a^2\\), and so on. There is a sequence of significance tests involved. Thus, the significance level that determines the \\(t\\)-value is not meaningful. By considering each variable separately, the algorithm does not take into account the joint effect of explanatory variables. Purely automatic procedures may not take into account an investigator’s special knowledge. Many of the criticisms of the basic stepwise regression algorithm can be addressed with modern computing software that is now widely available. We now consider each drawback, in reverse order. To respond to drawback number (7), many statistical software routines have options for forcing variables into a model equation. In this way, if other evidence indicates that one or more variables should be included in the model, then the investigator can force the inclusion of these variables. For drawback number (6), in Section 5.5.4 on suppressor variables, we will provide examples of variables that do not have important individual effects but are important when considered jointly. These combinations of variables may not be detected with the basic algorithm but will be detected with the backwards selection algorithm. Because the backwards procedure starts with all variables, it will detect, and retain, variables that are jointly important. Drawback number (5) is really a suggestion about the way to use stepwise regression. Bendel and Afifi (1977) suggested using a cut-off smaller than you ordinarily might. For example, in lieu of using \\(t\\)-value = 2 corresponding approximately to a 5% significance level, consider using \\(t\\)-value = 1.645 corresponding approximately to a 10% significance level. In this way, there is less chance of screening out variables that may be important. A lower bound, but still a good choice for exploratory work, is a cut-off as small as \\(t\\)-value = 1. This choice is motivated by an algebraic result: when a variable enters a model, \\(s\\) will decrease if the \\(t\\)-ratio exceeds one in absolute value. To address drawbacks number (3) and (4), we now introduce the best regressions routine. Best regressions is a useful algorithm that is now widely available in statistical software packages. The best regression algorithm searches over all possible combinations of explanatory variables, unlike stepwise regression, that adds and deletes one variable at a time. For example, suppose that there are four possible explanatory variables, \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), \\(x_3\\), and \\(x_4\\), and the user would like to know what is the best two-variable model. The best regression algorithm searches over all six models of the form \\(\\mathrm{E}~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\beta_2 x_j\\). Typically, a best regression routine recommends one or two models for each \\(p\\) coefficient model, where p is a number that is user-specified. Because it has specified the number of coefficients to enter the model, it does not matter which of the criteria we use: \\(R^2\\), \\(R_a^2\\), or \\(s\\). The best regression algorithm performs its search by a clever use of the algebraic fact that, when a variable is added to the model, the error sum of squares does not increase. Because of this fact, certain combinations of variables included in the model need not be computed. An important drawback of this algorithm is that it can take a considerable amount of time when the number of variables considered is large. Users of regression do not always appreciate the depth of drawback number (1), data-snooping. Data-snooping occurs when the analyst fits a great number of models to a data set. We will address the problem of data-snooping in Section 5.6.2 on model validation. Here, we illustrate the effect of data-snooping in stepwise regression. Example: Data-Snooping in Stepwise Regression. The idea of this illustration is due to Rencher and Pun (1980). Consider \\(n = 100\\) observations of \\(y\\) and fifty explanatory variables, \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{50}\\). The data we consider here were simulated using independent standard normal random variates. Because the variables were simulated independently, we are working under the null hypothesis of no relation between the response and the explanatory variables, that is, \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\ldots = \\beta_{50} = 0\\). Indeed, when the model with all fifty explanatory variables was fit, it turns out that \\(s = 1.142\\), \\(R^2 = 46.2\\%\\), and \\(F\\)-ratio = \\(\\frac{Regression~MS}{Error~MS} = 0.84\\). Using an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = 50\\) and \\(df_2 = 49\\), the 95th percentile is 1.604. In fact, 0.84 is the 27th percentile of this distribution, indicating that the \\(p\\)-value is 0.73. Thus, as expected, the data are in congruence with \\(H_0\\). Next, a stepwise regression with \\(t\\)-value = 2 was performed. Two variables were retained by this procedure, yielding a model with \\(s = 1.05\\), \\(R^2 = 9.5\\%\\), and \\(F\\)-ratio = 5.09. For an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = 2\\) and \\(df_2 = 97\\), the 95th percentile is \\(F\\)-value = 3.09. This indicates that the two variables are statistically significant predictors of \\(y\\). At first glance, this result is surprising. The data were generated so that \\(y\\) is unrelated to the explanatory variables. However, because \\(F\\)-ratio \\(&gt;\\) \\(F\\)-value, the \\(F\\)-test indicates that two explanatory variables are significantly related to \\(y\\). The reason is that stepwise regression has performed many hypothesis tests on the data. For example, in Step 1, fifty tests were performed to find significant variables. Recall that a 5% level means that we expect to make roughly one mistake in 20. Thus, with fifty tests, we expect to find \\(50 \\times 0.05 = 2.5\\) “significant” variables, even under the null hypothesis of no relationship between \\(y\\) and the explanatory variables. To continue, a stepwise regression with \\(t\\)-value = 1.645 was performed. Six variables were retained by this procedure, yielding a model with \\(s = 0.99\\), \\(R^2 = 22.9\\%\\), and \\(F\\)-ratio = 4.61. As before, an \\(F\\)-test indicates a significant relationship between the response and these six explanatory variables. To summarize, using simulation we constructed a data set so that the explanatory variables have no relationship with the response. However, when using stepwise regression to examine the data, we “found” seemingly significant relationships between the response and certain subsets of the explanatory variables. This example illustrates a general caveat in model selection: when explanatory variables are selected using the data, \\(t\\)-ratios and \\(F\\)-ratios will be too large, thus overstating the importance of variables in the model. Stepwise regression and best regressions are examples of automatic variable selection procedures. In your modeling work, you will find these procedures to be useful because they can quickly search through several candidate models. However, these procedures do ignore nonlinear alternatives as well as the effect of outliers and high leverage points. The main point of the procedures is to mechanize certain routine tasks. This automatic selection approach can be extended and indeed, there are a number of so-called “expert systems” available in the market. For example, algorithms are available that “automatically” handle unusual points such as outliers and high leverage points. A model suggested by automatic variable selection procedures should be subject to the same careful diagnostic checking procedures as a model arrived at by any other means. 5.3 Residual Analysis Recall the role of a residual in the linear regression model introduced in Section 2.6. A residual is a response minus the corresponding fitted value under the model. Because the model summarizes the linear effect of several explanatory variables, we may think of a residual as a response controlled for values of the explanatory variables. If the model is an adequate representation of the data, then residuals should closely approximate random errors. Random errors are used to represent the natural variation in the model; they represent the result of an unpredictable mechanism. Thus, to the extent that residuals resemble random errors, there should be no discernible patterns in the residuals. Patterns in the residuals indicate the presence of additional information that we hope to incorporate into the model. A lack of patterns in the residuals indicates that the model seems to account for the primary relationships in the data. 5.3.1 Residuals There are at least four types of patterns that can be uncovered through the residual analysis. In this section, we discuss the first two: residuals that are unusual and those that are related to other explanatory variables. We then introduce the third type, residuals that display a heteroscedastic pattern, in Section 5.7. In our study of time series data that begins in Chapter 7, we will introduce the fourth type, residuals that display patterns through time. When examining residuals, it is usually easier to work with a standardized residual, a residual that has been rescaled to be dimensionless. We generally work with standardized residuals because we achieve some carry-over of experience from one data set to another and may thus focus on relationships of interest. By using standardized residuals, we can train ourselves to look at a variety of residual plots and immediately recognize an unusual point when working in standard units. There are a number of ways of defining a standardized residual. Using \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\) as the \\(i\\)th residual, here are three commonly used definitions: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{(a) }\\frac{e_i}{s}, \\quad \\text{(b) }\\frac{e_i}{s\\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}}, \\quad \\text{(c) }\\frac{e_i}{s_{(i)}\\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}}. \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(h_{ii}\\) is the \\(i\\)th leverage. It is calculated based on values of the explanatory variables and will be defined in Section 5.4.1. Recall that \\(s\\) is the residual standard deviation (defined in equation 3.8). Similarly, define \\(s_{(i)}\\) to be the residual standard deviation when running a regression after having deleted the \\(i\\)th observation. Now, the first definition in (a) is simple and easy to explain. An easy calculation shows that the sample standard deviation of the residuals is approximately \\(s\\) (one reason that \\(s\\) is often referred to as the residual standard deviation). Thus, it seems reasonable to standardize residuals by dividing by \\(s\\). The second choice presented in (b), although more complex, is more precise. The variance of the \\(i\\)th residual is \\[ \\text{Var}(e_i) = \\sigma^2(1 - h_{ii}). \\] This result will be established in equation (5.15) of Section 5.10. Note that this variance is smaller than the variance of the error term, Var\\((\\varepsilon_i) = \\sigma^2\\). Now, we can replace \\(\\sigma\\) by its estimate, \\(s\\). Then, this result leads to using the quantity \\(s\\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}\\) as an estimated standard deviation, or standard error, for \\(e_i\\). Thus, we define the standard error of \\(e_i\\) to be \\[ \\text{se}(e_i) = s \\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}. \\] Following the conventions introduced in Section 2.6, in this text we use \\(e_i / \\text{se}(e_i)\\) to be our standardized residual. The third choice presented in (c) is a modification of (b) and is known as a studentized residual. As emphasized in Section 5.3.2, one important use of residuals is to identify unusually large responses. Now, suppose that the \\(i\\)th response is unusually large and that this is measured through its residual. This unusually large residual will also cause the value of \\(s\\) to be large. Because the large effect appears in both the numerator and denominator, the standardized residual may not detect this unusual response. However, this large response will not inflate \\(s_{(i)}\\) because it is constructed after having deleted the \\(i\\)th observation. Thus, when using studentized residuals, we get a better measure of observations that have unusually large residuals. By omitting this observation from the estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), the size of the observation affects only the numerator \\(e_i\\) and not the denominator \\(s_{(i)}\\). As another advantage, studentized residuals follow a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n - (k + 1)\\) degrees of freedom, assuming the errors are normally distributed (assumption E5). This knowledge of the precise distribution helps us assess the degree of model fit and is particularly useful in small samples. It is this relationship with the “Student’s” \\(t\\)-distribution that suggests the name “studentized” residuals. 5.3.2 Using Residuals to Identify Outliers One important role of residual analysis is to identify outliers. An outlier is an observation that is not well fit by the model; these are observations where the residual is unusually large. A rule of thumb that is used by many statistical packages is that an observation is marked as an outlier if the standardized residual exceeds two in absolute value. To the extent that the distribution of standardized residuals mimics the standard normal curve, we expect about only one in 20 observations, or 95%, to exceed two in absolute value and very few observations to exceed three. Outliers provide a signal that an observation should be investigated to understand special causes associated with this point. An outlier is an observation that seems unusual with respect to the rest of the data set. It is often the case that the reason for this atypical behavior may be uncovered after additional investigation. Indeed, this may be the primary purpose of the regression analysis of a data set. Consider a simple example of so-called performance analysis. Suppose we have available a sample of \\(n\\) salespeople and are trying to understand each person’s second-year sales based on their first-year sales. To a certain extent, we expect that higher first-year sales are associated with higher second-year sales. High sales may be due to a salesperson’s natural ability, ambition, good territory, and so on. First-year sales may be thought of as a proxy variable that summarizes these factors. We expect variation in sales performance both cross-sectionally and across years. It is interesting when one salesperson performs unusually well (or poorly) in the second year compared to their first-year performance. Residuals provide a formal mechanism for evaluating second-year sales after controlling for the effects of first-year sales. There are a number of options available for handling outliers. Options for Handling Outliers Include the observation in the usual summary statistics but comment on its effects. An outlier may be large but not so large as to skew the results of the entire analysis. If no special causes for this unusual observation can be determined, then this observation may simply reflect the variability in the data. Delete the observation from the data set. The observation may be determined to be unrepresentative of the population from which the sample is drawn. If this is the case, then there may be little information contained in the observation that can be used to make general statements about the population. This option means that we would omit the observation from the regression summary statistics and discuss it in our report as a separate case. Create a binary variable to indicate the presence of an outlier. If one or several special causes have been identified to explain an outlier, then these causes could be introduced into the modeling procedure formally by introducing a variable to indicate the presence (or absence) of these causes. This approach is similar to point deletion but allows the outlier to be formally included in the model formulation so that, if additional observations arise that are affected by the same causes, then they can be handled on an automatic basis. 5.3.3 Using Residuals to Select Explanatory Variables Another important role of residual analysis is to help identify additional explanatory variables that may be used to improve the formulation of the model. If we have specified the model correctly, then residuals should resemble random errors and contain no discernible patterns. Thus, when comparing residuals to explanatory variables, we do not expect any relationships. If we do detect a relationship, then this suggests the need to control for this additional variable. This can be accomplished by introducing the additional variable into the regression model. Relationships between residuals and explanatory variables can be quickly established using correlation statistics. However, if an explanatory variable is already included in the regression model, then the correlation between the residuals and an explanatory variable will be zero (see Section 5.10.1 for the algebraic demonstration). It is a good idea to reinforce this correlation with a scatter plot. Not only will a plot of residuals versus explanatory variables reinforce graphically the correlation statistic, it will also serve to detect potential nonlinear relationships. For example, a quadratic relationship can be detected using a scatter plot, not a correlation statistic. If you detect a relationship between the residuals from a preliminary model fit and an additional explanatory variable, then introducing this additional variable will not always improve your model specification. The reason is that the additional variable may be linearly related to the variables that are already in the model. If you would like a guarantee that adding an additional variable will improve your model, then construct an added variable plot (see Section 3.4.3). To summarize, after a preliminary model fit, you should: Calculate summary statistics and display the distribution of (standardized) residuals to identify outliers. Calculate the correlation between the (standardized) residuals and additional explanatory variables to search for linear relationships. Create scatter plots between the (standardized) residuals and additional explanatory variables to search for nonlinear relationships. Example: Stock Market Liquidity. An investor’s decision to purchase a stock is generally made with a number of criteria in mind. First, investors usually look for a high expected return. A second criterion is the riskiness of a stock, which can be measured through the variability of the returns. Third, many investors are concerned with the length of time that they are committing their capital with the purchase of a security. Many income stocks, such as utilities, regularly return portions of capital investments in the form of dividends. Other stocks, particularly growth stocks, return nothing until the sale of the security. Thus, the average length of investment in a security is another criterion. Fourth, investors are concerned with the ability to sell the stock at any time convenient to the investor. We refer to this fourth criterion as the liquidity of the stock. The more liquid the stock, the easier it is to sell. To measure liquidity, in this study we use the number of shares traded on an exchange over a specified period of time (called the VOLUME). We are interested in studying the relationship between the volume and other financial characteristics of a stock. We begin this study with 126 companies whose options were traded on December 3, 1984. The stock data were obtained from Francis Emory Fitch, Inc. for the period from December 3, 1984 to February 28, 1985. For the trading activity variables, we examine: The three months total trading volume (VOLUME, in millions of shares), The three months total number of transactions (NTRAN), and The average time between transactions (AVGT, measured in minutes). For the firm size variables, we use: Opening stock price on January 2, 1985 (PRICE), The number of outstanding shares on December 31, 1984 (SHARE, in millions of shares), and The market equity value (VALUE, in billions of dollars) obtained by taking the product of PRICE and SHARE. Finally, for the financial leverage, we examine the debt-to-equity ratio (DEB_EQ) obtained from the Compustat Industrial Tape and the Moody’s manual. The data in SHARE are obtained from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) monthly tape. After examining some preliminary summary statistics of the data, three companies were deleted because they either had an unusually large volume or high price. They are Teledyne and Capital Cities Communication, whose prices were more than four times the average price of the remaining companies, and American Telephone and Telegraph, whose total volume was more than seven times the average total volume of the remaining companies. Based on additional investigation, the details of which are not presented here, these companies were deleted because they seemed to represent special circumstances that we would not wish to model. Table 5.2 summarizes the descriptive statistics based on the remaining \\(n = 123\\) companies. For example, from Table 5.2, we see that the average time between transactions is about five minutes and this time ranges from a minimum of less than 1 minute to a maximum of about 20 minutes.

Table 5.3 reports the correlation coefficients and Figure 5.2 provides the corresponding scatterplot matrix. If you have a background in finance, you will find it interesting to note that the financial leverage, measured by DEB_EQ, does not seem to be related to the other variables. From the scatterplot and correlation matrix, we see a strong relationship between VOLUME and the size of the firm as measured by SHARE and VALUE. Further, the three trading activity variables, VOLUME, AVGT, and NTRAN, are all highly related to one another.

In fact, it turned out the correlation between the average time between transactions and the reciprocal of the number of transactions was \\(99.98\\%!\\) This is not so surprising when one thinks about how AVGT might be calculated. For example, on the New York Stock Exchange, the market is open from 10:00 A.M. to 4:00 P.M. For each stock on a particular day, the average time between transactions times the number of transactions is nearly equal to 360 minutes (= 6 hours). Thus, except for rounding errors because transactions are only recorded to the nearest minute, there is a perfect linear relationship between AVGT and the reciprocal of NTRAN. Figure 5.2: Scatterplot matrix for stock liquidity variables. The number of transactions variable (NTRAN) appears to be strongly related to the VOLUME of shares traded, and inversely related to AVGT. To begin to understand the liquidity measure VOLUME, we first fit a regression model using NTRAN as an explanatory variable. The fitted regression model is: \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{lcc} \\text{VOLUME} &amp;= 1.65 &amp;+ 0.00183 \\text{ NTRAN} \\\\ \\text{standard errors} &amp; (0.6173) &amp; (0.000074) \\end{array} } \\] with \\(R^2 = 83.4\\%\\) and \\(s = 4.35\\). Note that the \\(t\\)-ratio for the slope associated with NTRAN is \\[ t(b_1) = \\frac{b_1}{se(b_1)} = \\frac{0.00183}{0.000074} = 24.7 \\] indicating strong statistical significance. Residuals were computed using this estimated model. To see if the residuals are related to the other explanatory variables, Table 5.4 shows correlations. Table 5.4: First Table of Correlations Variable AVGT PRICE SHARE VALUE DEB_EQ RESID -0.159 -0.014 0.064 0.018 0.078 Note: The residuals were created from a regression of VOLUME on NTRAN. The correlation between the residual and AVGT and the scatter plot (not shown here) indicates that there may be some information in the variable AVGT in the residual. Thus, it seems sensible to use AVGT directly in the regression model. Remember that we are interpreting the residual as the value of VOLUME having controlled for the effect of NTRAN. We next fit a regression model using NTRAN and AVGT as explanatory variables. The fitted regression model is: \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{lccc} \\text{VOLUME} &amp;= 4.41 &amp;- 0.322 \\text{ AVGT} &amp;+ 0.00167 \\text{ NTRAN} \\\\ \\text{standard errors} &amp; (1.30)&amp; (0.135)&amp; (0.000098) \\end{array} } \\] with \\(R^2 = 84.2\\%\\) and \\(s = 4.26\\). Based on the \\(t\\)-ratio for AVGT, \\(t(b_{AVGT}) = \\frac{-0.322}{0.135} = -2.39\\), it seems as if AVGT is a useful explanatory variable in the model. Note also that \\(s\\) has decreased, indicating that \\(R_a^2\\) has increased. Table 5.5 provides correlations between the model residuals and other potential explanatory variables and indicates that there does not seem to be much additional information in the explanatory variables. This is reaffirmed by the corresponding table of scatter plots in Figure 5.3. The histograms in Figure 5.3 suggest that although the distribution of the residuals is fairly symmetric, the distribution of each explanatory variable is skewed. Because of this, transformations of the explanatory variables were explored. This line of thought provided no real improvements and thus the details are not provided here. Figure 5.3: Scatterplot matrix of the residuals from the regression of VOLUME on NTRAN and AVGT on the vertical axis and the remaining predictor variables on the horizontal axes. Table 5.5: Second Table of Correlations Variable PRICE SHARE VALUE DEB_EQ RESID -0.015 0.100 0.074 0.089 Note: The residuals were created from a regression of VOLUME on NTRAN and AVGT. 5.4 Influential Points Not all points are created equal – in this section we will see that specific observations can potentially have a disproportionate effect on the overall regression fit. We will call such points “influential.” This is not too surprising; we have already seen that regression coefficient estimates are weighted sums of responses (see Section 3.2.4). Some observations have heavier weights than others and thus have a greater influence on the regression coefficient estimates. Of course, simply because an observation is influential does not mean that it is incorrect or that its impact on the model is misleading. As analysts, we would simply like to know whether our fitted model is sensitive to mild changes such as the removal of a single point so that we feel comfortable generalizing our results from the sample to a larger population. To assess influence, we think of observations as being unusual responses, given a set of explanatory variables, or having an unusual set of explanatory variables values. We have already seen in Section 5.3 how to assess unusual responses using residuals. This section focuses on unusual sets of explanatory variables values. 5.4.1 Leverage We introduced this topic in Section 2.6 where we called an observation having an unusual explanatory variable value a “high leverage point.” With more than one explanatory variable, determining whether an observation is a high leverage point is not as straightforward. For example, it is possible for an observation to be “not unusual” for any single variable and yet still be unusual in the space of explanatory variables. Consider the fictitious data set represented in Figure 5.4. Visually, it seems clear that the point marked in the upper right-hand corner is unusual. However, it is not unusual when examining the histogram of either \\(x_1\\) or \\(x_2\\). It is only unusual when the explanatory variables are considered jointly. Figure 5.4: The ellipsoid represents most of the data. The arrow marks an unusual point. For two explanatory variables, this is apparent when examining the data graphically. Because it is difficult to examine graphically data having more than two explanatory variables, we need a numerical procedure for assessing leverage. To define the concept of leverage in multiple linear regression, we use some concepts from matrix algebra. Specifically, in Section 3.1, we showed that the vector of least squares regression coefficients could be calculated using \\(\\mathbf{b} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\). Thus, we can express the vector of fitted values \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = (\\hat{y}_1, \\ldots, \\hat{y}_n)^{\\prime}\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{Xb} . \\tag{5.2} \\end{equation}\\] Similarly, the vector of residuals is the vector of response minus the vector of fitted values, that is, \\(\\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{y - \\hat{y}}\\). From the expression for the regression coefficients \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) in equation (3.4), we have \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\] This equation suggests defining \\[ \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\] so that \\[ \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{Hy} \\] From this, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is said to project the vector of responses \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) onto the vector of fitted values \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\). Alternatively, you may think of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) as the matrix that puts the “hat,” or carat, on \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). From the \\(i\\)th row of the vector equation \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{Hy}\\), we have \\[ \\hat{y}_i = h_{i1} y_1 + h_{i2} y_2 + \\cdots + h_{ii} y_i + \\cdots + h_{in} y_n \\] Here, \\(h_{ij}\\) is the number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\). From this expression, we see that the larger \\(h_{ii}\\) is, the larger the effect that the \\(i\\)th response \\((y_i)\\) has on the corresponding fitted value \\((\\hat{y}_i)\\). Thus, we call \\(h_{ii}\\) the leverage for the \\(i\\)th observation. Because \\(h_{ii}\\) is the \\(i\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\mathbf{H}\\), a direct expression for \\(h_{ii}\\) is \\[\\begin{equation} h_{ii} = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\tag{5.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\ldots, x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\). Because the values \\(h_{ii}\\) are calculated based on the explanatory variables, the values of the response variable do not affect the calculation of leverages. Large leverage values indicate that an observation may exhibit a disproportionate effect on the fit, essentially because it is distant from the other observations (when looking at the space of explanatory variables). How large is large? Some guidelines are available from matrix algebra, where we have that \\[ \\frac{1}{n} \\le h_{ii} \\le 1 \\] and \\[ \\bar{h} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = \\frac{k+1}{n}. \\] Thus, each leverage is bounded by \\(n^{-1}\\) and \\(1\\), and the average leverage equals the number of regression coefficients divided by the number of observations. From these and related arguments, we use a widely adopted convention and declare an observation to be a high leverage point if the leverage exceeds three times the average, that is, if \\[ h_{ii} &gt; \\frac{3(k+1)}{n}. \\] Having identified high leverage points, as with outliers it is important for the analyst to search for special causes that may have produced these unusual points. To illustrate, in Section 2.7 we identified the 1987 market crash as the reason behind the high leverage point. Further, high leverage points are often due to clerical errors in coding the data, which may or may not be easy to rectify. In general, the options for dealing with high leverage points are similar to those available for dealing with outliers. Options for Handling High Leverage Points Include the observation in the summary statistics but comment on its effect. For example, an observation may barely exceed a cut-off and its effect may not be important in the overall analysis. Delete the observation from the data set. Again, the basic rationale for this action is that the observation is deemed not representative of some larger population. An intermediate course of action between (1) and (2) is to present the analysis both with and without the high leverage point. In this way, the impact of the point is fully demonstrated and the reader of your analysis may decide which option is more appropriate. Choose another variable to represent the information. In some instances, another explanatory variable will be available to serve as a replacement. For example, in an apartment rents example, we could use the number of bedrooms to replace a square footage variable as a measure of apartment size. Although an apartment’s square footage may be unusually large causing it to be a high leverage point, it may have one, two, or three bedrooms, depending on the sample examined. Use a nonlinear transformation of an explanatory variable. To illustrate, with our Stock Liquidity example in Section 5.5.3, we can transform the debt-to-equity DEB_EQ continuous variable into a variable that indicates the presence of “high” debt-to-equity. For example, we might code DE_IND = 1 if DEB_EQ &gt; 5 and DE_IND = 0 if DEB_EQ ≤ 5. With this recoding, we still retain information on the financial leverage of a company without allowing the large values of DEB_EQ to drive the regression fit. Some analysts use “robust” estimation methodologies as an alternative to least squares estimation. The basic idea of these techniques is to reduce the effect of any particular observation. These techniques are useful in reducing the effect of both outliers and high leverage points. This tactic may be viewed as intermediate between one extreme procedure, ignoring the effect of unusual points, and another extreme, giving unusual points full credibility by deleting them from the data set. The word robust is meant to suggest that these estimation methodologies are “healthy” even when attacked by an occasional bad observation (a germ). We have seen that this is not true for least squares estimation. 5.4.2 Cook’s Distance To quantify the influence of a point, a measure that considers both the response and explanatory variables is Cook’s Distance. This distance, \\(D_i\\), is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{array}{ll} D_i &amp;= \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_j - \\hat{y}_{j(i)})^2}{(k+1) s^2} \\tag{5.4} \\\\ &amp;= \\left( \\frac{e_i}{se(e_i)} \\right)^2 \\frac{h_{ii}}{(k+1)(1 - h_{ii})}. \\end{array} \\end{equation}\\] The first expression provides a definition. Here, \\(\\hat{y}_{j(i)}\\) is the prediction of the \\(j\\)th observation, computed leaving the \\(i\\)th observation out of the regression fit. To measure the impact of the \\(i\\)th observation, we compare the fitted values with and without the \\(i\\)th observation. Each difference is then squared and summed over all observations to summarize the impact. The second equation provides another interpretation of the distance \\(D_i\\). The first part, \\(\\left( \\frac{e_i}{se(e_i)} \\right)^2\\), is the square of the \\(i\\)th standardized residual. The second part, \\(\\frac{h_{ii}}{(k+1)(1 - h_{ii})}\\), is attributable solely to the leverage. Thus, the distance \\(D_i\\) is composed of a measure for outliers times a measure for leverage. In this way, Cook’s distance accounts for both the response and explanatory variables. Section 5.10.3 establishes the validity of equation (5.4). To get an idea of the expected size of \\(D_i\\) for a point that is not unusual, recall that we expect the standardized residuals to be about one and the leverage \\(h_{ii}\\) to be about \\(\\frac{k+1}{n}\\). Thus, we anticipate that \\(D_i\\) should be about \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\). Another rule of thumb is to compare \\(D_i\\) to an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = k+1\\) and \\(df_2 = n - (k+1)\\) degrees of freedom. Values of \\(D_i\\) that are large compared to this distribution merit attention. Example: Outliers and High Leverage Points - Continued. To illustrate, we return to our example in Section 2.6. In this example, we considered 19 “good,” or base, points plus each of the three types of unusual points, labeled A, B, and C. Table 5.6 summarizes the calculations. Table 5.6: Measures of Three Types of Unusual Points Observation Standardized Residual \\(e / se(e)\\) Leverage \\(h\\) Cook’s Distance \\(D\\) A 4.00 0.067 0.577 B 0.77 0.550 0.363 C -4.01 0.550 9.832 As noted in Section 2.6, from the standardized residual column we see that both points A and C are outliers. To judge the size of the leverages, because there are \\(n=20\\) points, the leverages are bounded by 0.05 and 1.00 with the average leverage being \\(\\bar{h} = \\frac{2}{20} = 0.10\\). Using 0.3 (\\(= 3 \\times \\bar{h}\\)) as a cut-off, both points B and C are high leverage points. Note that their values are the same. This is because, from Figure 2.7, the values of the explanatory variables are the same and only the response variable has been changed. The column for Cook’s distance captures both types of unusual behavior. Because the typical value of \\(D_i\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\) or 0.05, Cook’s distance provides one statistic to alert us to the fact that each point is unusual in one respect or another. In particular, point C has a very large \\(D_i\\), reflecting the fact that it is both an outlier and a high leverage point. The 95th percentile of an \\(F\\)-distribution with \\(df_1 = 2\\) and \\(df_2 = 18\\) is 3.555. The fact that point C has a value of \\(D_i\\) that well exceeds this cut-off indicates the substantial influence of this point. 5.5 Collinearity 5.5.1 What is Collinearity? Collinearity, or multicollinearity, occurs when one explanatory variable is, or nearly is, a linear combination of the other explanatory variables. Intuitively, with collinear data it is useful to think of explanatory variables as being highly correlated with one another. If an explanatory variable is collinear, then the question arises as to whether it is redundant, that is, whether the variable provides little additional information over and above the information in the other explanatory variables. The issues are: Is collinearity important? If so, how does it affect our model fit and how do we detect it? To address the first question, consider a somewhat pathological example. Example: Perfectly Correlated Explanatory Variables. Joe Finance was asked to fit the model \\(\\mathrm{E} ~y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2\\) to a data set. His resulting fitted model was \\(\\hat{y} = -87 + x_1 + 18 x_2.\\) The data set under consideration is: \\[ \\begin{array}{l|cccc} \\hline i &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\\\ \\hline y_i &amp; 23 &amp; 83 &amp; 63 &amp; 103 \\\\ x_{i1} &amp; 2 &amp; 8 &amp;6 &amp; 10 \\\\ x_{i2} &amp; 6 &amp; 9 &amp; 8 &amp; 10 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} \\] Joe checked the fit for each observation. Joe was very happy because he fit the data perfectly! For example, for the third observation the fitted value is \\(\\hat{y}_3 = -87 + 6 + 18 \\times 8 = 63\\) which is equal to the third response, \\(y_3\\). Because the response equals the fitted value, the residual is zero. You may check that this is true of each observation and thus the \\(R^2\\) turned out to be \\(100\\%\\). However, Jane Actuary came along and fit the model \\(\\hat{y} = -7 + 9 x_1 + 2 x_2.\\) Jane performed the same careful checks that Joe did and also got a perfect fit (\\(R^2 = 1\\)). Who is right? The answer is both and neither one. There are, in fact, an infinite number of fits. This is due to the perfect relationship \\(x_2 = 5 + \\frac{x_1}{2}\\) between the two explanatory variables. This example illustrates some important facts about collinearity. Collinearity Facts Collinearity neither precludes us from getting good fits nor from making predictions of new observations. Note that in the above example we got perfect fits. Estimates of error variances and, therefore, tests of model adequacy, are still reliable. In cases of serious collinearity, standard errors of individual regression coefficients are larger than cases where, other things equal, serious collinearity does not exist. With large standard errors, individual regression coefficients may not be meaningful. Further, because a large standard error means that the corresponding \\(t\\)-ratio is small, it is difficult to detect the importance of a variable. To detect collinearity, begin with a matrix of correlation coefficients of the explanatory variables. This matrix is simple to create, easy to interpret, and quickly captures linear relationships between pairs of variables. A scatterplot matrix provides a visual reinforcement of the summary statistics in the correlation matrix. 5.5.2 Variance Inflation Factors Correlation and scatterplot matrices capture only relationships between pairs of variables. To capture more complex relationships among several variables, we introduce the variance inflation factor (VIF). To define a VIF, suppose that the set of explanatory variables is labeled \\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{k}\\). Now, run the regression using \\(x_j\\) as the “response” and the other \\(x\\)’s (\\(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_{j-1}, x_{j+1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\)) as the explanatory variables. Denote the coefficient of determination from this regression by \\(R_j^2\\). We interpret \\(R_j = \\sqrt{R_j^2}\\) as the multiple correlation coefficient between \\(x_j\\) and linear combinations of the other \\(x\\)’s. From this coefficient of determination, we define the variance inflation factor \\[ VIF_j = \\frac{1}{1 - R_j^2}, \\text{ for } j = 1, 2, \\ldots, k. \\] A larger \\(R_j^2\\) results in a larger \\(VIF_j\\); this means greater collinearity between \\(x_j\\) and the other \\(x\\)’s. Now, \\(R_j^2\\) alone is enough to capture the linear relationship of interest. However, we use \\(VIF_j\\) in lieu of \\(R_j^2\\) as our measure for collinearity because of the algebraic relationship \\[\\begin{equation} se(b_j) = s \\frac{\\sqrt{VIF_j}}{s_{x_j} \\sqrt{n - 1}}. \\tag{5.5} \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(se(b_j)\\) and \\(s\\) are standard errors and residual standard deviation from a full regression fit of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_{k}\\). Further, \\(s_{x_j} = \\sqrt{(n - 1)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j)^2 }\\) is the sample standard deviation of the \\(j\\)th variable \\(x_j\\). Section 5.10.3 provides a verification of equation (5.5). Thus, a larger \\(VIF_j\\) results in a larger standard error associated with the \\(j\\)th slope, \\(b_j\\). Recall that \\(se(b_j)\\) is \\(s\\) times the square root of the \\((j+1)\\)st diagonal element of \\((\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\). The idea is that when collinearity occurs, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\) has properties similar to the number zero. When we attempt to calculate the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\), this is analogous to dividing by zero for scalar numbers. As a rule of thumb, when \\(VIF_j\\) exceeds 10 (which is equivalent to \\(R_j^2 &gt; 90\\%\\)), we say that severe collinearity exists. This may signal a need for action. Tolerance, defined as the reciprocal of the variance inflation factor, is another measure of collinearity used by some analysts. For example, with \\(k = 2\\) explanatory variables in the model, then \\(R_1^2\\) is the squared correlation between the two explanatory variables, say \\(r_{12}^2\\). Then, from the equation above, we have that \\[ se(b_j) = s \\left(s_{x_j} \\sqrt{n - 1} \\right)^{-1} \\left(1 - r_{12}^2 \\right)^{-1/2}, \\text{ for } j = 1, 2. \\] As the correlation approaches one in absolute value, \\(|r_{12}| \\rightarrow 1\\), then the standard error becomes large meaning that the corresponding \\(t\\)-statistic becomes small. In summary, a high \\(VIF\\) may mean small \\(t\\)-statistics even though variables are important. Further, one can check that the correlation between \\(b_1\\) and \\(b_2\\) is \\(-r_{12}\\), indicating that the coefficient estimates are highly correlated. Example: Stock Market Liquidity - Continued. As an example, consider a regression of VOLUME on PRICE, SHARE, and VALUE. Unlike the explanatory variables considered in Section 5.5.3, these three explanatory variables are not measures of trading activity. From a regression fit, we have \\(R^2 = 61\\%\\) and \\(s = 6.72\\). The statistics associated with the regression coefficients are in Table 5.7. Table 5.7: Statistics from a regression of VOLUME on PRICE, SHARE and VALUE \\(x_j\\) \\(s_{x_j}\\) \\(b_j\\) \\(se(b_j)\\) \\(t(b_j)\\) \\(VIF_j\\) PRICE 21.370 -0.022 0.035 -0.63 1.5 SHARE 115.100 0.054 0.010 5.19 3.8 VALUE 8.157 0.313 0.162 1.94 4.7 You may check that the relationship in equation (5.5) is valid for each of the explanatory variables in Table 5.7. Because each \\(VIF\\) statistic is less than ten, there is little reason to suspect severe collinearity. This is interesting because you may recall that there is a perfect relationship between PRICE, SHARE, and VALUE in that we defined the market value to be VALUE = PRICE \\(\\times\\) SHARE. However, the relationship is multiplicative, and hence is nonlinear. Because the variables are not linearly related, it is valid to enter all three into the regression model. From a financial perspective, the variable VALUE is important because it measures the worth of a firm. From a statistical perspective, the variable VALUE quantifies the interaction between PRICE and SHARE (interaction variables were introduced in Section 3.5.3). For collinearity, we are only interested in detecting linear trends, so nonlinear relationships between variables are not an issue here. For example, we have seen that it is sometimes useful to retain both an explanatory variable \\(x\\) and its square \\(x^2\\), despite the fact that there is a perfect (nonlinear) relationship between the two. Still, we must check that nonlinear relationships are not approximately linear over the sampling region. Even though the relationship is theoretically nonlinear, if it is close to linear for our available sample, then problems of collinearity might arise. Figure 5.5 illustrates this situation. Figure 5.5: The relationship between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is nonlinear. However, over the region sampled, the variables have close to a linear relationship. What can we do in the presence of collinearity? One option is to center each variable, by subtracting its average and dividing by its standard deviation. For example, create a new variable \\(x_{ij}^{\\ast} = (x_{ij} - \\bar{x}_j) / s_{x_j}\\). Occasionally, one variable appears as millions of units and another variable appears as fractions of units. Compared to the first mentioned variable, the second variable is close to a constant column of zeros (in that computers typically retain a finite number of digits). If this is true, then the second variable looks very much like a linear shift of the constant column of ones corresponding to the intercept. This is a problem because, with the least squares operations, we are implicitly squaring numbers that can make these columns appear even more similar. This problem is simply a computational one and is easy to rectify. Simply recode the variables so that the units are of similar order of magnitude. Some data analysts automatically center all variables to avoid these problems. This is a legitimate approach because regression techniques search for linear relationships; location and scale shifts do not affect linear relationships. Another option is to simply not explicitly account for collinearity in the analysis but to discuss some of its implications when interpreting the results of the regression analysis. This approach is probably the most commonly adopted one. It is a fact of life that, when dealing with business and economic data, collinearity does tend to exist among variables. Because the data tends to be observational in lieu of experimental in nature, there is little that the analyst can do to avoid this situation. In the best-case situation, an auxiliary variable that provides similar information and that eases the collinearity problem is available to replace a variable. Similar to our discussion of high leverage points, a transformed version of the explanatory variable may also be a useful substitute. In some situations, such an ideal replacement is not available and we are forced to remove one or more variables. Deciding which variables to remove is a difficult choice. When deciding among variables, often the choice will be dictated by the investigator’s judgement as to which is the most relevant set of variables. 5.5.3 Collinearity and Leverage Measures of collinearity and leverage share common characteristics and yet are designed to capture different aspects of a data set. Both are useful for data and model criticism; they are applied after a preliminary model fit with the objective of improving model specification. Further, both are calculated using only the explanatory variables; values of the responses do not enter into either calculation. Our measure of collinearity, the variance inflation factor, is designed to help with model criticism. It is a measure calculated for each explanatory variable, designed to explain the relationship with other explanatory variables. The leverage statistic is designed to help us with data criticism. It is a measure calculated for each observation to help us explain how unusual an observation is with respect to other observations. Collinearity may be masked, or induced, by high leverage points, as pointed out by Mason and Gunst (1985) and Hadi (1988). Figures 5.6 and 5.7 provide illustrations of each case. These simple examples underscore an important point: data criticism and model criticism are not separate exercises. Figure 5.6: With the exception of the marked point, \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are highly linearly related. Figure 5.7: The highly linear relationship between \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) is primarily due to the marked point. The examples in Figures 5.6 and 5.7 also help us to see one way in which high leverage points may affect standard errors of regression coefficients. Recall, in Section 5.4.1, we saw that high leverage points may affect the model fitted values. In Figures 5.6 and 5.7, we see that high leverage points affect collinearity. Thus, from equation (5.5), we have that high leverage points can also affect our standard errors of regression coefficients. 5.5.4 Suppressor Variables As we have seen, severe collinearity can seriously inflate standard errors of regression coefficients. Because we rely on these standard errors for judging the usefulness of explanatory variables, our model selection procedures and inferences may be deficient in the presence of severe collinearity. Despite these drawbacks, mild collinearity in a data set should not be viewed as a deficiency of the data set; it is simply an attribute of the available explanatory variables. Even if one explanatory variable is nearly a linear combination of the others, that does not necessarily mean that the information that it provides is redundant. To illustrate, we now consider a suppressor variable, an explanatory variable that increases the importance of other explanatory variables when included in the model. Example: Suppressor Variable. Figure 5.8 shows a scatterplot matrix of a hypothetical data set of fifty observations. This data set contains a response and two explanatory variables. Table 5.8 provides the corresponding matrix of correlation coefficients. Here, we see that the two explanatory variables are highly correlated. Now recall, for regression with one explanatory variable, that the correlation coefficient squared is the coefficient of determination. Thus, using Table 5.8, for a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1\\), the coefficient of determination is \\((0.188)^2 = 3.5\\%\\). Similarly, for a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_2\\), the coefficient of determination is \\((-0.022)^2 = 0.04\\%\\). However, for a regression of \\(y\\) on \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), the coefficient of determination turns out to be a surprisingly high \\(80.7\\%\\). The interpretation is that individually, both \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) have little impact on \\(y\\). However, when taken jointly, the two explanatory variables have a significant effect on \\(y\\). Although Table 5.8 shows that \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) are strongly linearly related, this relationship does not mean that \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) provide the same information. In fact, in this example the two variables complement one another. Figure 5.8: Scatterplot matrix of a response and two explanatory variables for the suppressor variable example Table 5.8: Correlation Matrix for the Suppressor Example \\(x_1\\) \\(x_2\\) \\(x_2\\) 0.972 \\(y\\) 0.188 -0.022 5.5.5 Orthogonal Variables Another way to understand the impact of collinearity is to study the case when there are no relationships among sets of explanatory variables. Mathematically, two matrices \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}_2\\) are said to be orthogonal if \\(\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_2 = \\mathbf{0}\\). Intuitively, because we generally work with centered variables (with zero averages), this means that each column of \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) is uncorrelated with each column of \\(\\mathbf{X}_2\\). Although unlikely to occur with observational data in the social sciences, when designing experimental treatments or constructing high degree polynomials, applications of orthogonal variables are regularly used (see for example, Hocking, 2003). For our purposes, we will work with orthogonal variables simply to understand the logical consequences of a total lack of collinearity. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) is an explanatory variable that is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\), where \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) is a matrix of explanatory variables that includes the intercept. Then, it is straightforward to check that the addition of \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) to the regression equation does not change the fit for coefficients corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\). That is, without \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\), the coefficients corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\) would be calculated as \\(\\mathbf{b}_1 = \\left(\\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_1 \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}\\). Using the orthogonal \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) as part of the least squares calculation would not change the result for \\(\\mathbf{b}_1\\) (see the recursive least squares calculation in Section 4.7.2). Further, the variance inflation factor for \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) is 1, indicating that the standard error is unaffected by the other explanatory variables. In the same vein, the reduction in the error sum of squares by adding the orthogonal variable \\(\\mathbf{x}_2\\) is due only to that variable, and not its interaction with other variables in \\(\\mathbf{X}_1\\). Orthogonal variables can be created for observational social science data (as well as other collinear data) using the method of principal components. With this method, one uses a linear transformation of the matrix of explanatory variables of the form, \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{P}\\), so that the resulting matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast}\\) is composed of orthogonal columns. The transformed regression function is \\(\\mathrm{E~}\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathbf{X}^{\\ast} \\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\ast}\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is the set of new regression coefficients. Estimation proceeds as before, with the orthogonal set of explanatory variables. By choosing the matrix \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) appropriately, each column of \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast}\\) has an identifiable contribution. Thus, we can readily use variable selection techniques to identify the “principal components” portions of \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast}\\) to use in the regression equation. Principal components regression is a widely used method in some application areas, such as psychology. It can easily address highly collinear data in a disciplined manner. The main drawback of this technique is that the resulting parameter estimates are difficult to interpret. 5.6 Selection Criteria 5.6.1 Goodness of Fit How well does the model fit the data? Criteria that measure the proximity of the fitted model and realized data are known as goodness of fit statistics. Specifically, we interpret the fitted value \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) to be the best model approximation of the \\(i\\)th observation and compare it to the actual value \\(y_i\\). In linear regression, we examine the difference through the residual \\(e_i = y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\); small residuals imply a good model fit. We have quantified this through the size of the typical error \\((s)\\), including the coefficient of determination \\((R^2)\\) and an adjusted version \\((R_{a}^2)\\). For nonlinear models, we will need additional measures, and it is helpful to introduce these measures in this simpler linear case. One such measure is Akaike’s Information Criterion that will be defined in terms of likelihood fits in Section 11.9.4. For linear regression, it reduces to \\[\\begin{equation} AIC = n \\ln (s^2) + n \\ln (2 \\pi) + n + 3 + k. \\tag{5.6} \\end{equation}\\] For model comparison, the smaller the \\(AIC\\), the better is the fit. Comparing models with the same number of variables (\\(k\\)) means that selecting a model with small values of \\(AIC\\) leads to the same choice as selecting a model with small values of the residual standard deviation \\(s\\). Further, a small number of parameters means a small value of \\(AIC\\), other things being equal. The idea is that this measure balances the fit (\\(n \\ln (s^2)\\)) with a penalty for complexity (the number of parameters, \\(k+2\\)). Statistical packages often omit constants such as \\(n \\ln (2 \\pi)\\) and \\(n+3\\) when reporting \\(AIC\\) because they do not matter when comparing models. Section 11.9.4 will introduce another measure, the Bayes Information Criterion (\\(BIC\\)), that gives a smaller weight to the penalty for complexity. A third goodness of fit measure that is used in linear regression models is the \\(C_p\\) statistic. To define this statistic, assume that we have available \\(k\\) explanatory variables \\(x_1, ..., x_{k}\\) and run a regression to get \\(s_{full}^2\\) as the mean square error. Now, suppose that we are considering using only \\(p-1\\) explanatory variables so that there are \\(p\\) regression coefficients. With these \\(p-1\\) explanatory variables, we run a regression to get the error sum of squares \\((Error~SS)_p\\). Thus, we are in the position to define \\[ C_{p} = \\frac{(Error~SS)_p}{s_{full}^2} - n + 2p. \\] As a selection criterion, we choose the model with a “small” \\(C_{p}\\) coefficient, where small is taken to be relative to \\(p\\). In general, models with smaller values of \\(C_{p}\\) are more desirable. Like the \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) statistics, the \\(C_{p}\\) statistic strikes a balance between the model fit and complexity. That is, each statistic summarizes the trade-off between model fit and complexity, although with different weights. For most data sets, they recommend the same model and so an analyst can report any or all three statistics. However, for some applications, they lead to different recommended models. In this case, the analyst needs to rely more heavily on non-data driven criteria for model selection (which are always important in any regression application). 5.6.2 Model Validation Model validation is the process of confirming that our proposed model is appropriate, especially in light of the purposes of the investigation. Recall the iterative model formulation selection process described in Section 5.1. An important criticism of this iterative process is that it is guilty of data-snooping, that is, fitting a great number of models to a single set of data. As we saw in Section 5.2 on data-snooping in stepwise regression, by looking at a large number of models we may overfit the data and understate the natural variation in our representation. We can respond to this criticism by using a technique called out-of-sample validation. The ideal situation is to have available two sets of data, one for model development and one for model validation. We initially develop one, or several, models on a first data set. The models developed from the first set of data are called our candidate models. Then, the relative performance of the candidate models could be measured on a second set of data. In this way, the data used to validate the model is unaffected by the procedures used to formulate the model. Unfortunately, rarely will two sets of data be available to the investigator. However, we can implement the validation process by splitting the data set into two subsamples. We call these the model development and validation subsamples, respectively. They are also known as training and testing samples, respectively. To see how the process works in the linear regression context, consider the following procedure. Out-of-Sample Validation Procedure Begin with a sample size of \\(n\\) and divide it into two subsamples, called the model development and validation subsamples. Let \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) denote the size of each subsample. In cross-sectional regression, do this split using a random sampling mechanism. Use the notation \\(i=1,...,n_1\\) to represent observations from the model development subsample and \\(i=n_1+1,...,n_1+n_2=n\\) for the observations from the validation subsample. Figure 5.9 illustrates this procedure. Using the model development subsample, fit a candidate model to the data set \\(i=1,...,n_1\\). Using the model created in Step (ii) and the explanatory variables from the validation subsample, “predict” the dependent variables in the validation subsample, \\(\\hat{y}_i\\), where \\(i=n_1+1,...,n_1+n_2\\). (To get these predictions, you may need to transform the dependent variables back to the original scale.) Assess the proximity of the predictions to the held-out data. One measure is the sum of squared prediction errors \\[\\begin{equation} SSPE = \\sum_{i=n_1+1}^{n_1+n_2} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 . \\tag{5.7} \\end{equation}\\] Repeat Steps (ii) through (iv) for each candidate model. Choose the model with the smallest SSPE. Figure 5.9: For model validation, a data set of size \\(n\\) is randomly split into two subsamples There are a number of criticisms of the SSPE. First, it is clear that it takes a considerable amount of time and effort to calculate this statistic for each of several candidate models. However, as with many statistical techniques, this is merely a matter of having specialized statistical software available to perform the steps described above. Second, because the statistic itself is based on a random subset of the sample, its value will vary from analyst to analyst. This objection could be overcome by using the first \\(n_1\\) observations from the sample. In most applications, this is not done in case there is a lurking relationship in the order of the observations. Third, and perhaps most important, is the fact that the choice of the relative subset sizes, \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\), is not clear. Various researchers recommend different proportions for the allocation. Snee (1977) suggests that data-splitting not be done unless the sample size is moderately large, specifically, \\(n \\geq 2(k+1) + 20\\). The guidelines of Picard and Berk (1990) show that the greater the number of parameters to be estimated, the greater the proportion of observations needed for the model development subsample. As a rule of thumb, for data sets with 100 or fewer observations, use about 25-35% of the sample for out-of-sample validation. For data sets with 500 or more observations, use 50% of the sample for out-of-sample validation. Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2001) remark that a typical split is 50% for development/training, 25% for validation, and the remaining 25% for a third stage for further validation that they call testing. Because of these criticisms, several variants of the basic out-of-sample validation process are used by analysts. Although there is no theoretically best procedure, it is widely agreed that model validation is an important part of confirming the usefulness of a model. 5.6.3 Cross-Validation Cross-validation is the technique of model validation that splits the data into two disjoint sets. Section 5.6.2 discussed out-of-sample validation where the data was split randomly into two subsets both containing a sizeable percentage of data. Another popular method is leave-one-out cross-validation, where the validation sample consists of a single observation and the development sample is based on the remainder of the data set. Especially for small sample sizes, an attractive leave-one-out cross-validation statistic is PRESS, the Predicted Residual Sum of Squares. To define the statistic, consider the following procedure where we suppose that a candidate model is available. PRESS Validation Procedure From the full sample, omit the \\(i\\)th point and use the remaining \\(n-1\\) observations to compute regression coefficients. Use the regression coefficients computed in step one and the explanatory variables for the \\(i\\)th observation to compute the predicted response, \\(\\hat{y}_{(i)}\\). This part of the procedure is similar to the calculation of the SSPE statistic with \\(n_1=n-1\\) and \\(n_2=1\\). Now, repeat (i) and (ii) for \\(i=1,...,n\\). Summarizing, define \\[\\begin{equation} PRESS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_{(i)})^2 . \\tag{5.8} \\end{equation}\\] As with SSPE, this statistic is calculated for each of several competing models. Under this criterion, we choose the model with the smallest PRESS. Based on this definition, the statistic seems very computationally intensive in that it requires \\(n\\) regression fits to evaluate it. To address this, interested readers will find that Section 5.10.2 establishes \\[\\begin{equation} y_i - \\hat{y}_{(i)} = \\frac{e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} . \\tag{5.9} \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(e_i\\) and \\(h_{ii}\\) represent the \\(i\\)th residual and leverage from the regression fit using the complete data set. This yields \\[\\begin{equation} PRESS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\right)^2 , \\tag{5.10} \\end{equation}\\] which is a much easier computational formula. Thus, the PRESS statistic is less computationally intensive than SSPE. Another important advantage of this statistic, when compared to SSPE, is that we do not need to make an arbitrary choice as to our relative subset sizes split. Indeed, because we are performing an “out-of-sample” validation for each observation, it can be argued that this procedure is more efficient, an especially important consideration when the sample size is small (say, less than 50 observations). A disadvantage is that because the model is re-fit for each point deleted, PRESS does not enjoy the appearance of independence between the estimation and prediction aspects, unlike SSPE. 5.7 Heteroscedasticity In most regression applications, the goal is to understand determinants of the regression function \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mu_i\\). Our ability to understand the mean is strongly influenced by the amount of spread from the mean that we quantify using the variance \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left(y_i - \\mu_i\\right)^2\\). In some applications, such as when I weigh myself on a scale, there is relatively little variability; repeated measurements yield almost the same result. In other applications, such as the time it takes me to fly to New York, repeated measurements yield substantial variability and are fraught with inherent uncertainty. The amount of uncertainty can also vary on a case-by-case basis. We denote the case of “varying variability” with the notation \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{E}\\left(y_i - \\mu_i\\right)^2\\). When the variability varies by observation, this is known as heteroscedasticity for “different scatter.” In contrast, the usual assumption of common variability (assumption E3/F3 in Section 3.2) is called homoscedasticity, meaning “same scatter.” Our estimation strategies depend on the extent of heteroscedasticity. For datasets with only a mild amount of heteroscedasticity, one can use least squares to estimate the regression coefficients, perhaps combined with an adjustment for the standard errors (described in Section 5.7.2). This is because least squares estimators are unbiased even in the presence of heteroscedasticity (see Property 1 in Section 3.2). However, with heteroscedastic dependent variables, the Gauss-Markov theorem no longer applies and so the least squares estimators are not guaranteed to be optimal. In cases of severe heteroscedasticity, alternative estimators are used, the most common being those based on transformations of the dependent variable, as will be described in Section 5.7.4. 5.7.1 Detecting Heteroscedasticity To decide a strategy for handling potential heteroscedasticity, we must first assess, or detect, its presence. To detect heteroscedasticity graphically, a good idea is to perform a preliminary regression fit of the data and plot the residuals versus the fitted values. To illustrate, Figure 5.10 is a plot of a fictitious data set with one explanatory variable where the scatter increases as the explanatory variable increases. A least squares regression was performed - residuals and fitted values were computed. Figure 5.11 is an example of a plot of residuals versus fitted values. The preliminary regression fit removes many of the major patterns in the data and leaves the eye free to concentrate on other patterns that may influence the fit. We plot residuals versus fitted values because the fitted values are an approximation of the expected value of the response and, in many situations, the variability grows with the expected response. Figure 5.10: The shaded area represents the data. Figure 5.11: Residuals plotted versus the fitted values for the data in Figure 5.10. More formal tests of heteroscedasticity are also available in the regression literature. To illustrate, let us consider a test due to Breusch and Pagan (1980). Specifically, this test examines the alternative hypothesis \\(H_a\\): $ y_i = ^2 + _i^{} $, where \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) is a known vector of variables and \\(\\boldsymbol \\gamma\\) is a \\(p\\)-dimensional vector of parameters. Thus, the null hypothesis is \\(H_0:~ \\boldsymbol \\gamma = \\mathbf{0}\\) is equivalent to homoscedasticity, \\(\\mathrm{Var~} y_i = \\sigma^2.\\) Procedure to Test for Heteroscedasticity Fit a regression model and calculate the model residuals, \\(e_i\\). Calculate squared standardized residuals, \\(e_i^{\\ast 2} = e_i^2 / s^2\\). Fit a regression model of \\(e_i^{\\ast 2}\\) on \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\). The test statistic is \\(LM = \\frac{\\text{Regress~SS}_z}{2}\\), where \\(Regress~SS_z\\) is the regression sum of squares from the model fit in step (iii). Reject the null hypothesis if \\(LM\\) exceeds a percentile from a chi-square distribution with \\(p\\) degrees of freedom. The percentile is one minus the significance level of the test. Here, we use \\(LM\\) to denote the test statistic because Breusch and Pagan derived it as a Lagrange multiplier statistic; see Breusch and Pagan (1980) for more details. 5.7.2 Heteroscedasticity-Consistent Standard Errors For data sets with only mild heteroscedasticity, a sensible strategy is to employ least squares estimators of the regression coefficients and to adjust the calculation of standard errors to account for the heteroscedasticity. From the Section 3.2 on properties, we saw that least squares regression coefficients could be written as \\(\\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{w}_i y_i,\\) where \\(\\mathbf{w}_i = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i\\). Thus, with \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{Var~} y_i\\), we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{w}_i \\mathbf{w}_i^{\\prime} \\sigma_i^2 = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sigma_i^2 \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1}. \\tag{5.11} \\end{equation}\\] This quantity is known except for \\(\\sigma_i^2\\). We can compute residuals using the least squares regression coefficients as \\(e_i = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}\\). With these, we may define the empirical, or robust, estimate of the variance-covariance matrix as \\[ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2 \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1}. \\] The corresponding “heteroscedasticity-consistent” standard errors are \\[\\begin{equation} se_r(b_j) = \\sqrt{(j+1)^{\\text{st}}~ \\text{diagonal element of }\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}}}. \\tag{5.12} \\end{equation}\\] The logic behind this estimator is that each squared residual, \\(e_i^2\\), may be a poor estimate of \\(\\sigma_i^2\\). However, our interest is estimating a (weighted) sum of variances in equation (5.11); estimating the sum is a much easier task than estimating any individual variance estimate. Robust, or heteroscedasticity-consistent, standard errors are widely available in statistical software packages. Here, you will also see alternative definitions of residuals employed, as in Section 5.3.1. If your statistical package offers options, the robust estimator using studentized residuals is generally preferred. 5.7.3 Weighted Least Squares The least squares estimators are less useful for datasets with severe heteroscedasticity. One strategy is to use a variation of least squares estimation by weighting observations. The idea is that, when minimizing the sum of squared errors using heteroscedastic data, the expected variability of some observations is smaller than others. Intuitively, it seems reasonable that the smaller the variability of the response, the more reliable that response and the greater weight that it should receive in the minimization procedure. Weighted least squares is a technique that accounts for this “varying variability.” Specifically, we use Section 3.2.3 assumptions E1, E2, and E4, with E3 replaced by E \\(\\varepsilon_i = 0\\) and \\(\\text{Var} \\varepsilon_i = \\sigma^2 / w_i\\), so that the variability is proportional to a known weight \\(w_i\\). For example, if unit of analysis \\(i\\) represents a geographical entity such as a state, you might use the number of people in the state as a weight. Or, if \\(i\\) represents a firm, you might use firm assets for the weighting variable. Larger values of \\(w_i\\) indicate a more precise response variable through the smaller variability. In actuarial applications, weights are used to account for an exposure such as the amount of insurance premium, number of employees, size of the payroll, number of insured vehicles, and so forth (further discussion is in Chapter 18). This model can be readily converted to the “ordinary” least squares problem by multiplying all regression variables by \\(\\sqrt{w_i}\\). That is, if we define \\(y_i^{\\ast} = y_i \\times \\sqrt{w_i}\\) and \\(x_{ij}^{\\ast} = x_{ij} \\times \\sqrt{w_i}\\), then from assumption E1 we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} y_i^{\\ast} &amp; = y_i \\times \\sqrt{w_i} = \\left( \\beta_0 x_{i0} + \\beta_1 x_{i1} + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_{ik} + \\varepsilon_i \\right) \\sqrt{w_i} \\\\ &amp;= \\beta_0 x_{i0}^{\\ast} + \\beta_1 x_{i1}^{\\ast} + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_{ik}^{\\ast} + \\varepsilon_i^{\\ast} \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\varepsilon_i^{\\ast} = \\varepsilon_i \\times \\sqrt{w_i}\\) has homoscedastic variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Thus, with the rescaled variables, all inference can proceed as before. This work has been automated in statistical packages where the user merely specifies the weights \\(w_i\\) and the package does the rest. In terms of matrix algebra, this procedure can be accomplished by defining an \\(n \\times n\\) weight matrix \\(\\mathbf{W} = \\text{diag}(w_i)\\) so that the \\(i\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) is \\(w_i\\). Extending equation (3.14) for example, the weighted least squares estimates can be expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{b}_{WLS} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{y}. \\tag{5.13} \\end{equation}\\] Additional discussions of weighted least squares estimation will be presented in Section 15.1.1. 5.7.4 Transformations Another approach that handles severe heteroscedasticity, introduced in Section 1.3, is to transform the dependent variable, typically with a logarithmic transformation of the form \\(y^{\\ast} = \\ln y\\). As we saw in Section 1.3, transformations can serve to “shrink” spread out data and symmetrize a distribution. Through a change of scale, a transformation also changes the variability, potentially altering a heteroscedastic dataset into a homoscedastic one. This is both a strength and limitation of the transformation approach - a transformation simultaneously affects both the distribution and the heteroscedasticity. Power transformations, such as the logarithmic transform, are most useful when the variability of the data grows with the mean. In this case, the transform will serve to “shrink” the data to a scale that appears to be homoscedastic. Conversely, because transformations are monotonic functions, they will not help with patterns of variability that are non-monotonic. Further, if your data is reasonably symmetric but heteroscedastic, a transformation will not be useful because any choice that mitigates the heteroscedasticity will skew the distribution. When data are non-positive, it is common to add a constant to each observation so that all observations are positive prior to transformation. For example, the transform \\(\\ln(1+y)\\) accommodates the presence of zeros. One can also multiply by a constant so that the approximate original units are retained. For example, the transform \\(100 \\ln(1 + y/100)\\) may be applied to percentage data where negative percentages sometimes appear. Our discussions of transformations have focused on transforming dependent variables. As noted in Section 3.5, transformations of explanatory variables are also possible. This is because the regression assumptions condition on explanatory variables (Section 3.2.3). Some analysts prefer to transform variables to approximate normality, thinking of multivariate normal distributions as a foundation for regression analysis. Others are reluctant to transform explanatory variables because of the difficulties in interpreting resulting models. The approach taken here is to use transforms that can be readily interpretable, such as those introduced in Section 3.5. Other transforms are certainly candidates to include in a selected model but they should provide substantial dividends in terms of fit or predictive power if they are difficult to communicate. 5.8 Further Reading and References Long and Ervin (2000) gather compelling evidence for the use of alternative heteroscedasticity-consistent estimators of standard errors that have better finite sample performance than the classic versions. The large sample properties of empirical estimators have been established by Eicker (1967), Huber (1967) and White (1980) in the linear regression case. For the linear regression case, MacKinnon and White (1985) suggest alternatives that provide superior small-sample properties. For small samples, the evidence is based on (1) the biasedness of the estimators, (2) their motivation as jackknife estimators and (3) their performance in simulation studies. Other measures of collinearity based on matrix algebra concepts involving eigenvalues, such as condition numbers and condition indices, are used by some analysts. See Belseley, Kuh and Welsch (1980) for a solid treatment of collinearity and regression diagnostics. Hocking (2003) provides additional background reading on collinearity and principal components. See Carroll and Ruppert (1988) for further discussions of transformations in regression. Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman (2001) give an advanced discussion of model selection issues, focusing on predictive aspects of models in the language of machine learning.

National Life Expectancies. We continue the analysis begun in Exercises 1.7, 2.22, 3.6 and 4.7. The focus of this exercise is variable selection. Begin with the data from \\(n=185\\) countries throughout the world that have valid (non-missing) life expectancies. Plot the life expectancy versus the gross domestic product and private expenditures on health. From these plots, describe why it is desirable to use logarithmic transforms, lnGDP and lnHEALTH, respectively. Also plot life expectancy versus lnGDP and lnHEALTH to confirm your intuition. Use a stepwise regression algorithm to help you select a model. Do not consider the variables RESEARCHERS, SMOKING, and FEMALEBOSS as these have many missing values. For the remaining variables, use only the observations without any missing values. Do this twice, with and without the categorical variable EGION. Return to the full data set of \\(n=185\\) countries and run a regression model using FERTILITY, PUBLICEDUCATION, and $lnHEALTH as explanatory variables. c(i). Provide histograms of standardized residuals and leverages. c(ii). Identify the standardized residual and leverage associated with Lesotho, formerly Basutoland, a kingdom surrounded by South Africa. Is this observation an outlier, high leverage point, or both? c(iii). Re-run the regression without Lesotho. Cite any differences in the statistical coefficients between this model and the one in part c(i). 5.4. Term Life Insurance. We continue our study of Term Life Insurance Demand from Chapters 3 and 4. Specifically, we examine the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally representative sample that contains extensive information on assets, liabilities, income, and demographic characteristics of those sampled (potential U.S. customers). We study a random sample of 500 families with positive incomes. From the sample of 500, we initially consider a subsample of \\(n=275\\) families that purchased term life insurance. Consider a linear regression of LNINCOME, EDUCATION, NUMHH, MARSTAT, AGE, and GENDER on LNFACE}. Collinearity. Not all of the variables turned out to be statistically significant. To investigate one possible explanation, calculate variance inflation factors. a(i). Briefly explain the idea of collinearity and a variance inflation factor. a(ii). What constitutes a large variance inflation factor? a(iii). If a large variance inflation factor is detected, what possible courses of action do we have to address this aspect of the data? a(iv). Supplement the variance inflation factor statistics with a table of correlations of explanatory variables. Based on these statistics, is collinearity an issue with this fitted model? Why or why not? Unusual Points. Sometimes a poor model fit can be due to unusual points. b(i). Define the idea of leverage for an observation. b(ii). For this fitted model, give standard rules of thumb for identifying points with unusual leverage. Identify any unusual points from the attached summary statistics. b(iii). An analyst is concerned with leverage values for this fitted model and suggests using FACE as the dependent variable instead of LNFACE. Describe how leverage values would change using this alternative dependent variable. Residual Analysis. We can learn how to improve model fits from analyses of residuals. c(i). Provide a plot of residuals versus fitted values. What do we hope to learn from this type of plot? Does this plot display any model inadequacies? c(ii). Provide a \\(qq\\) plot of residuals. What do we hope to learn from this type of plot? Does this plot display any model inadequacies? c(iii). Provide a plot of residuals versus leverages. What do we hope to learn from this type of plot?

Suppose that this algorithm suggests a model using LNINCOME}, EDUCATION, NUMHH, and GENDER as explanatory variables to predict the dependent variable LNFACE. d(i). What is the purpose of stepwise regression? d(ii). Describe two important drawbacks of stepwise regression algorithms. 5.10 Technical Supplements for Chapter 5 5.10.1 Projection Matrix Hat Matrix. We define the hat matrix to be \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X(X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X)}^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\), so that \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{X b} = \\mathbf{Hy}\\). From this, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is said to project the vector of responses \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) onto the vector of fitted values \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\). Because \\(\\mathbf{H}^{\\prime} = \\mathbf{H}\\), the hat matrix is symmetric. Further, it is also an idempotent matrix due to the property that \\(\\mathbf{HH} = \\mathbf{H}\\). To see this, we have that \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{HH} &amp;= \\mathbf{(X(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{)(X(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{)} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{X(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} = \\mathbf{X(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}X)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} = \\mathbf{H}. \\end{array} \\] Similarly, it is easy to check that \\(\\mathbf{I-H}\\) is idempotent. Because \\(\\mathbf{H}\\) is idempotent, from some results in matrix algebra, it is straightforward to show that \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = k + 1. \\] As discussed in Section 5.4.1, we use our bounds and the average leverage, \\(\\bar{h} = (k + 1)/n\\), to help identify observations with unusually high leverage. Variance of Residuals. Using the model equation \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\), we can express the vector of residuals as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{y - Hy} = \\mathbf{(I-H)(X \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon})} = \\mathbf{(I-H) \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}. \\tag{5.14} \\end{equation}\\] The last equality is due to the fact that \\(\\mathbf{(I-H)X} = \\mathbf{X - HX} = \\mathbf{X - X} = \\mathbf{0}\\). Using \\(\\text{Var~} \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\), we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Var } \\mathbf{e} &amp;= \\text{Var }\\left[ \\mathbf{(I-H)\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} \\right] = \\mathbf{(I-H)} \\text{Var } \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\mathbf{(I-H)} \\\\ &amp;= \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{(I-H)} \\mathbf{I} \\mathbf{(I-H)} = \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{(I-H)}. \\end{array} \\] The last equality comes from the fact that \\(\\mathbf{I-H}\\) is idempotent. Thus, we have that \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Var } e_i = \\sigma^2 (1 - h_{ii}) \\text{ and Cov } (e_i, e_j) = -\\sigma^2 h_{ij}. \\tag{5.15} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, although the true errors \\(\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\\) are uncorrelated, there is a small negative correlation among residuals \\(\\mathbf{e}\\). Dominance of the Error in the Residual. Examining the \\(i\\)th row of equation (5.14), we have that the \\(i\\)th residual \\[\\begin{equation} e_i = \\varepsilon_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{ij} \\varepsilon_j \\tag{5.16} \\end{equation}\\] can be expressed as a linear combination of independent errors. The relation \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{HH}\\) yields \\[\\begin{equation} h_{ii} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{ij}^2. \\tag{5.17} \\end{equation}\\] Because \\(h_{ii}\\) is, on average, \\((k + 1)/n\\), this indicates that each \\(h_{ij}\\) is small relative to 1. Thus, when interpreting equation (5.16), we say that most of the information in \\(e_i\\) is due to \\(\\varepsilon_i\\). Correlations with Residuals. First define \\(\\mathbf{x}^j = (x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\dots, x_{nj})^{\\prime}\\) to be the column representing the \\(j\\)th variable. With this notation, we can partition the matrix of explanatory variables as \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\left( \\mathbf{x}^{0}, \\mathbf{x}^{1}, \\dots, \\mathbf{x}^{k} \\right)\\). Now, examining the \\(j\\)th column of the relation \\(\\mathbf{(I-H)X} = \\mathbf{0}\\), we have \\(\\mathbf{(I-H)x}^{j} = \\mathbf{0}\\). With \\(\\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{(I-H) \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}}\\), this yields \\[ \\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{x}^{j} = \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{(I-H)x}^{j} = 0, \\] for \\(j = 0, 1, \\ldots, k.\\) This result has several implications. If the intercept is in the model, then \\(\\mathbf{x}^{0} = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)^{\\prime}\\) is a vector of ones. Here, \\(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{x}^{0} = 0\\) means that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i = 0\\) or, the average residual is zero. Further, because \\(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{x}^{j} = 0\\), it is easy to check that the sample correlation between \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}^{j}\\) is zero. Along the same line, we also have that \\(\\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{e}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{(I-H)Xb} = \\mathbf{0}\\). Thus, using the same argument as above, the sample correlation between \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\) is zero. Multiple Correlation Coefficient. For an example of a non-zero correlation, consider \\(r(\\mathbf{y, \\hat{y}})\\), the sample correlation between \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\). Because \\(\\mathbf{(I-H)x}^{0} = \\mathbf{0}\\), we have \\(\\mathbf{x}^{0} = \\mathbf{Hx}^{0}\\) and thus, \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{x}^{0} = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Hx}^{0} = \\mathbf{y^{\\prime} x}^{0}\\). Assuming \\(\\mathbf{x}^{0} = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)^{\\prime}\\), this means that \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\hat{y}_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\\), so that the average fitted value is \\(\\bar{y}\\). \\[ r(\\mathbf{y, \\hat{y}}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})}{(n-1) s_y s_{\\hat{y}}}. \\] Recall that \\((n-1) s_y^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = Total ~SS\\) and \\((n-1) s_{\\hat{y}}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y})^2 = Regress ~SS\\). Further, with \\(\\mathbf{x}^0 = (1, 1, \\ldots, 1)^{\\prime}\\), \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})(\\hat{y}_i - \\bar{y}) &amp;= (\\mathbf{y} - \\bar{y} \\mathbf{x}^0)^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} - \\bar{y} \\mathbf{x}^0) = \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{\\hat{y}} - \\bar{y}^2 \\mathbf{x}^{0 \\prime} \\mathbf{x}^0 \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{Xb} - n \\bar{y}^2 = Regress ~SS. \\end{array} \\] This yields \\[\\begin{equation} r(\\mathbf{y, \\hat{y}}) = \\frac{Regress ~SS}{\\sqrt{\\left( Total ~SS \\right) \\left( Regress ~SS \\right)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{Regress ~SS}{Total ~SS}} = \\sqrt{R^2}. \\tag{5.18} \\end{equation}\\] That is, the coefficient of determination can be interpreted as the square root of the correlation between the observed and fitted responses. 5.10.2 Leave One Out Statistics Notation. To test the sensitivity of regression quantities, there are a number of statistics of interest that are based on the notion of “leaving out,” or omitting, an observation. To this end, the subscript notation \\((i)\\) means to leave out the \\(i\\)th observation. For example, omitting the row of explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} = (x_{i0}, x_{i1}, \\dots, x_{ik})\\) from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) yields \\(\\mathbf{X}_{(i)}\\), a \\((n-1) \\times (k+1)\\) matrix of explanatory variables. Similarly, \\(\\mathbf{y}_{(i)}\\) is a \\((n-1) \\times 1\\) vector, based on removing the \\(i\\)th row from \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). Basic Matrix Result. Suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is an invertible, \\(p \\times p\\) matrix and \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) is a \\(p \\times 1\\) vector. The following result from matrix algebra provides an important tool for understanding leave one out statistics in linear regression analysis. \\[\\begin{equation} \\left( \\mathbf{A - zz}^{\\prime} \\right)^{-1} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1} + \\frac{\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{zz}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A}^{-1}}{1 - \\mathbf{z}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\mathbf{z}}. \\tag{5.19} \\end{equation}\\] To check this result, simply multiply \\(\\mathbf{A - zz}^{\\prime}\\) by the right hand side of the equation to get \\(\\mathbf{I}\\), the identity matrix. Vector of Regression Coefficients. Omitting the \\(i\\)th observation, our new vector of regression coefficients is \\(\\mathbf{b}_{(i)} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_{(i)} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}_{(i)}.\\) An alternative expression for \\(\\mathbf{b}_{(i)}\\) that is simpler to compute turns out to be \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} = \\mathbf{b} - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i e_i}{1 - h_{ii}}.S \\tag{5.20} \\end{equation}\\] To verify this, first use the matrix inversion result with \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{x}_i\\) to get \\[ \\left( \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_{(i)} \\right)^{-1} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime})^{-1} = (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} + \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1}}{1 - h_{ii}}, \\] where, from the leverage result, we have \\(h_{ii} = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i\\). Multiplying each side by \\[ \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}_{(i)} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}_i y_i \\] yields \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} &amp;= \\left( \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}_{(i)} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}_{(i)}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}_{(i)} \\\\ &amp;= \\left( (\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} + \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1}}{1 - h_{ii}} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{x}_i y_i \\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{b} - \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i y_i + \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} - \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i y_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{b} - \\frac{\\left( 1 - h_{ii} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i y_i - \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} - \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i h_{ii} y_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{b} - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i y_i - \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}}{1 - h_{ii}} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{b} - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i e_i}{1 - h_{ii}}. \\end{array} \\] This establishes the result. Cook’s Distance. To measure the effect, or influence, of omitting the \\(i\\)th observation, Cook examined the difference between fitted values with and without the observation. We define Cook’s Distance to be \\[ D_i = \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{\\hat{y} - \\hat{y}}_{(i)} \\right)^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{\\hat{y} - \\hat{y}}_{(i)} \\right)}{(k+1) s^2} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}_{(i)} = \\mathbf{Xb}_{(i)}\\) is the vector of fitted values calculated omitting the \\(i\\)th point. Using equation (5.20) and \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}} = \\mathbf{Xb}\\), an alternative expression for Cook’s Distance is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} D_i &amp;= \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{b - b}_{(i)} \\right)^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{b - b}_{(i)} \\right)}{(k+1) s^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{e_i^2}{(1 - h_{ii})^2} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i}{(k+1) s^2} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{e_i^2}{(1 - h_{ii})^2} \\frac{h_{ii}}{(k+1) s^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\left( \\frac{e_i}{s \\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}} \\right)^2 \\frac{h_{ii}}{(k+1) (1 - h_{ii})}. \\end{array} \\] This result is not only useful computationally, it also serves to decompose the statistic into the part due to the standardized residual, \\((e_i/(s \\sqrt{1 - h_{ii}}))^2\\), and due to the leverage, \\(\\frac{h_{ii}}{(k+1) (1 - h_{ii})}\\). Leave One Out Residual. The leave one out residual is defined by \\(e_{(i)} = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)}\\). It is used in computing the PRESS statistic, described in Section 5.6.3. A simple computational expression is \\(e_{(i)} = \\frac{e_i}{1 - h_{ii}}\\). To verify this, use equation (5.20) to get \\[ e_{(i)} = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{b} - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\right) \\] \\[ = e_i + \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} = e_i + \\frac{h_{ii} e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} = \\frac{e_i}{1 - h_{ii}}. \\] Leave One Out Variance Estimate. The leave one out estimate of the variance is defined by \\[ s_{(i)}^2 = \\frac{((n - 1) - (k + 1))^{-1} \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\left( y_j - \\mathbf{x}_j^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} \\right)^2}{(n - 1) - (k + 1)}. \\] It is used in the definition of the studentized residual, defined in Section 5.3.1. A simple computational expression is given by \\[\\begin{equation} s_{(i)}^2 = \\frac{(n - (k + 1)) s^2 - \\frac{e_i^2}{1 - h_{ii}}}{(n - 1) - (k + 1)}. \\tag{5.21} \\end{equation}\\] To see this, first note that from equation (5.14), we have \\(\\mathbf{He} = \\mathbf{H(I - H) \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}} = \\mathbf{0}\\), because \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{HH}\\). In particular, from the \\(i\\)th row of \\(\\mathbf{He} = \\mathbf{0}\\), we have \\(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{ij} e_j = 0\\). Now, using equations (5.17) and (5.20), we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\sum_{j \\ne i} \\left( y_j - \\mathbf{x}_j^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} \\right)^2 &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( y_j - \\mathbf{x}_j^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} \\right)^2 - \\left( y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{(i)} \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( y_j - \\mathbf{x}_j^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} + \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_j^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_i e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\right) - e_{(i)}^2 \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( e_j + \\frac{h_{ij} e_i}{1 - h_{ii}} \\right)^2 - \\frac{e_i^2}{(1 - h_{ii})^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} e_j^2 + 0 + \\frac{e_i^2}{(1 - h_{ii})^2} h_{ii} - \\frac{e_i^2}{(1 - h_{ii})^2} \\\\ &amp;= \\sum_{j=1}^{n} e_j^2 - \\frac{e_i^2}{1 - h_{ii}} = (n - (k + 1)) s^2 - \\frac{e_i^2}{1 - h_{ii}}. \\end{array} \\] This establishes equation (5.21). 5.10.3 Omitting Variables Notation. To measure the effect on regression quantities, there are a number of statistics of interest that are based on the notion of omitting an explanatory variable. To this end, the superscript notation \\((j)\\) means to omit the \\(j\\)th variable, where \\(j=0,1,\\ldots,k\\). First, recall that \\(\\mathbf{x}^{j} = (x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \\ldots, x_{nj})^{\\prime}\\) is the column representing the \\(j\\)th variable. Further, define \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(j)}\\) to be the \\(n \\times k\\) matrix of explanatory variables defined by removing \\(\\mathbf{x}^{j}\\) from \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). For example, taking \\(j=k\\), we often partition \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) as \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{(k)}: \\mathbf{x}^k \\right)\\). Employing the results of Section 4.7.2, we will use \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{X}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}^k = \\mathbf{X}_2\\). Variance Inflation Factor. We first would like to establish the relationship between the definition of the standard error of \\(b_j\\) given by \\[ se(b_j) = s \\sqrt{(j+1)\\text{th diagonal element of }(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}} \\] and the relationship involving the variance inflation factor, \\[ se(b_j) = s \\frac{\\sqrt{VIF_j}}{s_{x_j}\\sqrt{n-1}}. \\] By symmetry of the independent variables, we only need to consider the case where \\(j=k\\). Thus, we would like to establish \\[\\begin{equation} (k+1)\\text{th diagonal element of }(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X})^{-1} = \\frac{VIF_{k}}{(n-1) s_{x_{k}}^2}. \\tag{5.22} \\end{equation}\\] First consider the reparameterized model in equation (4.22). From equation (4.23), we can express the regression coefficient estimate \\[ b_{k} = \\frac{\\mathbf{e}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{y}}{\\mathbf{e}_1^{\\prime}\\mathbf{e}_1}. \\] From equation (4.23), we have that \\(\\text{Var} \\, b_{k} = \\sigma^2 (\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)^{-1}\\) and thus \\[\\begin{equation} se(b_{k}) = s (\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)^{-1/2}. \\tag{5.23} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\((\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)^{-1}\\) is the \\((k+1)\\)th diagonal element of \\[ \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1^{\\prime} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_1 &amp; \\mathbf{E}_2 \\end{bmatrix} \\right)^{-1} \\] and is also the \\((k+1)\\)th diagonal element of \\((\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\). Alternatively, this can be verified directly using the partitioned matrix inverse in equation (4.19). Now, suppose that we run a regression using \\(\\mathbf{x}^{k} = \\mathbf{X}_2\\) as the response vector and \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{X}_1\\) as the matrix of explanatory variables. As noted above equation (4.22), \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\) represents the “residuals” from this regression and thus \\(\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2\\) represents the error sum of squares. For this regression, the total sum of squares is \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{ik} - \\bar{x}_{k})^2 = (n-1) s_{x_{k}}^2 \\] and the coefficient of determination is \\(R_{k}^2\\). Thus, \\[ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 = Error ~SS = Total ~SS (1 - R_{k}^2) = \\frac{(n-1) s_{x_{k}}^2}{VIF_{k}}. \\] This establishes the result. Establishing \\(t^2 = F\\). For testing the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\): \\(\\beta_{k} = 0\\), the material in Section 3.4.1 provides a description of a test based on the \\(t\\)-statistic, \\(t(b_{k}) = \\frac{b_{k}}{se(b_{k})}\\). An alternative test procedure, described in Sections 4.2.2, uses the test statistic \\[ F-\\text{ratio} = \\frac{(Error ~SS)_{reduced} - (Error ~SS)_{full}}{p \\times (Error~MS)_{full}} = \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right)^2}{s^2 \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2} \\] from equation (4.26). Alternatively, from equations (4.23) and (5.23), we have \\[\\begin{equation} t(b_{k}) = \\frac{b_{k}}{se(b_{k})} = \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right) / \\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 \\right)}{s / \\sqrt{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}} = \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right)}{s \\sqrt{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}}. \\tag{5.24} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\(t(b_{k})^2 = F\\)-ratio. Partial Correlation Coefficients. From the full regression model \\[ \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}^{(k)} + \\mathbf{x}_{k} \\beta_{k} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}, \\] consider two separate regressions. A regression using \\(\\mathbf{x}^{k}\\) as the response vector and \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\\) as the matrix of explanatory variables yields the residuals \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\). Similarly, a regression with \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) as the response vector and \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\\) as the matrix of explanatory variables yields the residuals \\[ \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{(k)\\prime} \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\mathbf{y}. \\] If \\(x^{0} = (1,1,\\ldots,1)^{\\prime}\\), then the average of \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\) is zero. In this case, the sample correlation between \\(\\mathbf{E}_1\\) and \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\) is \\[ r(\\mathbf{E}_1, \\mathbf{E}_2) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{1i} E_{2i}}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{1i}^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E_{2i}^2 \\right)}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 \\right) \\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 \\right)}}. \\] Because \\(\\mathbf{E}_2\\) is a vector of residuals using \\(\\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\\) as the matrix of explanatory variables, we have that \\(\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} = 0\\). Thus, for the numerator, we have \\[ \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 = \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\left( \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{(k)\\prime} \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^{(k)} \\mathbf{y} \\right) = \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}. \\] From equations (4.24) and (4.25), we have that \\[ (n - (k+1)) s^2 = (Error ~SS)_{full} = \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right)^2}{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2} = \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 \\right)^2}{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}. \\] Thus, from equation (5.24) \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{t(b_{k})}{\\sqrt{t(b_{k})^2 + n - (k+1)}} &amp;= \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} / \\left(s \\sqrt{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right)^2}{s^2 \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2} + n - (k+1)}} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y}}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{y} \\right)^2 + \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 s^2 \\left(n - (k+1) \\right)}} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1}{\\sqrt{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 \\right)^2 + \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2 \\left( \\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 - \\frac{\\left( \\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1 \\right)^2}{\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2} \\right)}} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{\\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2}{\\sqrt{(\\mathbf{E}_1^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_1) (\\mathbf{E}_2^{\\prime} \\mathbf{E}_2)}} = r(\\mathbf{E}_1, \\mathbf{E}_2). \\end{array} \\] This establishes the relationship between the partial correlation coefficient and the \\(t\\)-ratio statistic.

A regression analyst collects data, selects a model and then reports on the findings of the study, in that order. This chapter considers these three topics in reverse order, emphasizing how each stage of the study is influenced by preceding steps. An application, determining a firm’s characteristics that influence its effectiveness in managing risk, illustrates the regression modeling process from start to finish. Studying a problem using a regression modeling process involves a substantial commitment of time and energy. One must first embrace the concept of statistical thinking, a willingness to use data actively as part of a decision making process. Second, one must appreciate the usefulness of a model that is used to approximate a real situation. Having made this substantial commitment, there is a natural tendency to “oversell” the results of statistical methods such as regression analysis. By overselling any set of ideas, consumers eventually become disappointed when the results do not live up to their expectations. This chapter begins in Section 6.1 by summarizing what we can reasonably expect to learn from regression modeling. Models are designed to be much simpler than relationships among entities that exist in the real world. A model is merely an approximation of reality. As stated by George Box (1979), “All models are wrong, but some are useful.” Developing the model, the subject of Chapter 5, is part of the art of statistics. Although the principles of variable selection are widely accepted, the application of these principles can vary considerably among analysts. The resulting product has certain aesthetic values and is by no means predetermined. Statistics can be thought of as the art of reasoning with data. Section 6.2 will underscore the importance of variable selection. Model formulation and data collection form the first stage of the modeling process. Students of statistics are usually surprised at the difficulty of relating ideas about relationships to available data. These difficulties include a lack of readily available data and the need to use certain data as proxies for ideal information that is not available numerically. Section 6.3 will describe several types of difficulties that can arise when collecting data. Section 6.4 will describe some models to alleviate these difficulties. 6.1 What the Modeling Process Tells Us Model inference is the final stage of the modeling process. By studying the behavior of models, we hope to learn something about the real world. Models serve to impose an order on reality and provide a basis for understanding reality through the nature of the imposed order. Further, statistical models are based on reasoning with the available data from a sample. Thus, models serve as an important guide for predicting the behavior of observations outside the available sample. 6.1.1 Interpreting Individual Effects When interpreting results from multiple regression, the main goal is often to convey the importance of individual variables, or effects, on an outcome of interest. The interpretation depends on whether or not the effects are substantively significant, statistically significant and causal. Substantive Significance. Readers of a regression study first want to understand the direction and magnitude of individual effects. Do females have more or less claims than males in a study of insurance claims? If less, by how much? You can give answers to these questions through a table of regression coefficients. Moreover, to give a sense of the reliability of the estimates, you may also wish to include the standard error or a confidence interval, as introduced in Section 3.4.2. Recall that regression coefficients are estimates of partial derivatives of the regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k. \\] When interpreting coefficients for continuous explanatory variables, it is helpful to do so in terms of meaningful changes of each \\(x\\). For example, if population is an explanatory variable, we may talk about the expected change in \\(y\\) per 1,000 or one million change in population. Moreover, when interpreting regression coefficients, comment on their “substantive” significance. For example, suppose that we find a difference in claims between males and females but the estimated difference is only 1% of expected claims. This difference may well be statistically significant but not economically meaningful. Substantive significance refers to importance in the field of inquiry; in actuarial science, this is typically financial or economic significance but could also be non-monetary, such as effects on future life expectancy. Statistical Significance. Are the effects due to chance? The hypothesis testing machinery introduced in Section 3.4.1 provides a formal mechanism for answering this question. Tests of hypotheses are useful in that they provide a formal, agreed-upon standard, for deciding whether or not a variable provides an important contribution to an expected response. When interpreting results, typically researchers cite a \\(t\\)-ratio or a \\(p\\)-value to demonstrate statistical significance. In some situations, it is of interest to comment on variables that are not statistically significant. Effects that are not statistically significant have standard errors that are large relative to the regression coefficients. In Section 5.5.2, we expressed this standard error as \\[\\begin{equation} se(b_{j}) = s \\frac{\\sqrt{VIF_{j}}}{s_{x_{j}} \\sqrt{n-1}}. \\tag{6.1} \\end{equation}\\] One possible explanation for a lack of statistical significance is a large variation in the disturbance term. By expressing the standard error in this form, we see that the larger the natural variation, as measured by \\(s\\), the more difficult it is to reject the null hypothesis of no effect (\\(H_0\\)), other things being equal. A second possible explanation for the lack of statistical significance is the high collinearity, as measured by \\(VIF_j\\). A variable may be confounded with other variables such that, from the data being analyzed, it is impossible to distinguish the effects of one variable from another. A third possible explanation is the sample size. Suppose that a mechanism similar to draws from a stable population is used to observe the explanatory variables. Then, the standard deviation of \\(x_j\\), \\(s_{x_j}\\), should be stable as the number of draws increases. Similarly, so should \\(R_j^2\\) and \\(s^2\\). Then, the standard error \\(se(b_j)\\) should decrease as the sample size, \\(n\\), increases. Conversely, a smaller sample size means a larger standard error, other things being equal. This means that we may not be able to detect the importance of variables in small or moderate size samples. Thus, in an ideal world, if you do not detect statistical significance where it was hypothesized (and fully expected), you could: (i) get a more precise measure of \\(y\\), thus reducing its natural variability, (ii) re-design the sample collection scheme so that the relevant explanatory variables are less redundant and (iii) collect more data. Typically, these options are not available with observational data but it can nonetheless be helpful to point out the next steps in a research program. Analysts occasionally observe statistically significant relationships that were not anticipated—these could be due to a large sample size. Above we noted that a small sample may not provide enough information to detect meaningful relationships. The flip side of this argument is that, for large samples, we have an opportunity for detecting the importance of variables that might go unnoticed in small or even moderate size samples. Unfortunately, it also means that variables with small parameter coefficients, that contribute little to understanding the variation in the response, can be judged to be significant using our decision-making procedures. This serves to highlight the difference between substantive and statistical significance—particularly for large samples, investigators encounter variables that are statistically significant but practically unimportant. In these cases, it can be prudent for the investigator to omit variables from the model specification when their presence is not in accord with accepted theory, even if they are judged statistically significant. Causal Effects. If we change \\(x\\), would \\(y\\) change? As students of basic sciences, we learned principles involving actions and reactions. Adding mass to a ball in motion increases the force of its impact into a wall. However, in the social sciences, relationships are probabilistic, not deterministic, and hence more subtle. For example, as age (\\(x\\)) increases, the one-year probability of death (\\(y\\)) increases for most human mortality curves. Understanding causality, even probabilistic, is the root of all science and provides the basis for informed decision-making. It is important to acknowledge that causal processes generally cannot be demonstrated exclusively from the data; the data can only present relevant empirical evidence serving as a link in a chain of reasoning about causal mechanisms. For causality, there are three necessary conditions: (i) statistical association between variables, (ii) appropriate time order and (iii) the elimination of alternative hypotheses or establishment of a formal causal mechanism. As an example, recall the Section 1.1 Galton study, relating adult children’s height (\\(y\\)) to an index of parents’ height (\\(x\\)). For this study, it was clear that there is a strong statistical association between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The demographics also make it clear that the parents’ measurements (\\(x\\)) precede the children’s measurements (\\(y\\)). What is uncertain is the causal mechanism. For example, in Section 1.5, we cited the possibility that an omitted variable, family diet, could be influencing both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Evidence and theories from human biology and genetics are needed to establish a formal causal mechanism. Example: Race, Redlining and Automobile Insurance Prices. In an article with this title, Harrington and Niehaus (1998) investigated whether insurance companies engaged in (racial) discriminatory behavior, often known as redlining. Racial discrimination is illegal and insurance companies may not use race in determining prices. The term redlining refers to the practice of drawing red lines on a map to indicate areas that insurers will not serve, areas typically containing a high proportion of minorities. To investigate whether or not there exists racial discrimination in insurance pricing, Harrington and Niehaus gathered private passenger premiums and claims data from the Missouri Department of Insurance for the period 1988-1992. Although insurance companies do not keep race/ethnicity information in their premiums and claims data, such information is available at the zip code level from the US Census Bureau. By aggregating premiums and claims up to the zip code level, Harrington and Niehaus were able to assess whether areas with a higher percentage of blacks paid more for insurance (PCTBLACK). A widely used pricing measure is the loss ratio, defined to be the ratio of claims to premiums. This measures insurers’ profitability; if racial discrimination exists in pricing, one would expect to see a low loss ratio in areas with a high proportion of minorities. Harrington and Niehaus used this as the dependent variable, after taking logarithms to address the skewness in the loss ratio distribution. Harrington and Niehaus (1998) studied 270 zip codes surrounding six major cities in Missouri where there were large concentrations of minorities. Table 6.1 reports findings from comprehensive coverage although the authors also investigated collision and liability coverage. In addition to the primary variable of interest, PCTBLACK, a few control variables relating to age distribution (PCT1824 and PCT55UP), marital status (MARRIED), population (ln TOTPOP) and employment (PCTUNEMP) were introduced. Policy size was measured indirectly through an average car value (ln AVCARV). Table 6.1 reports that only policy size and population are statistically significant determinants of loss ratios. In fact, the coefficient associated with PCTBLACK has a positive sign, indicating that premiums are lower in areas with high concentrations of minorities (although, not significant). In an efficient insurance market, we would expect prices to be closely aligned with claims and that few broad patterns exist.

Establishing a lack of statistical significance is typically more difficult than establishing significance. In the paper by Harrington and Niehaus (1998), there are many alternative model specifications that assess the robustness of their findings to different variable selection procedures and different data subsets. Table 6.1 reports coefficient estimators and \\(t\\)-ratios calculated using weighted least squares, with population size as weights. The authors also ran (ordinary) least squares, with robust standard errors, achieving similar results. 6.1.2 Other Interpretations When taken collectively, linear combinations of the regression coefficients can be interpreted as the regression function: \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_k. \\] When reporting regression results, readers want to know how well the model fits the data. Section 5.6.1 summarized several goodness of fit statistics that are routinely reported in regression investigations. Regression Function and Pricing. When evaluating insurance claims data, the regression function represents expected claims and hence forms the basis of the pricing function. (See the example in Chapter 4.) In this case, the shape of the regression function and levels for key combinations of explanatory variables are of interest. Benchmarking Studies. In some investigations, the main purpose may be to determine whether a specific observation is “in line” with the others available. For example, in Chapter 20 we will examine CEO salaries. The main purpose of such an analysis could have been to see whether a person’s salary is high or low compared to others in the sample, controlling for characteristics such as industry and years of experience. The residual summarizes the deviation of the response from that expected under the model. If the residual is unusually large or small, then we interpret this to mean that there are unusual circumstances associated with this observation. This analysis does not suggest the nature nor the causes of these circumstances. It merely states that the observation is unusual with respect to others in the sample. For some investigations, such as for litigation concerning compensation packages, this is a powerful statement. Prediction. Many actuarial applications concern prediction, where the interest is on describing the distribution of a random variable that is not yet realized. When setting reserves, insurance company actuaries are establishing liabilities for future claims that they predict will be realized, and thus becoming eventual expenses of the company. Prediction, or forecasting, is the main motivation of most analyses of time series data, the subject of Chapters 7-10. Prediction of a single random variable in the multiple linear regression context was introduced in Section 4.2.3. Here, we assumed that we have available a given set of characteristics, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}=(1,x_{\\ast 1},\\ldots,x_{\\ast k})^{\\prime }\\). According to our model, the new response is \\[ y_{\\ast}=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_{\\ast 1} + \\cdots + \\beta_k x_{\\ast k} + \\varepsilon_{\\ast}. \\] We use as our point predictor \\[ \\hat{y}_{\\ast}=b_{0} + b_{1} x_{\\ast 1} + \\cdots + b_{k} x_{\\ast k}. \\] As in Section 2.5.3, we can decompose the prediction error into the estimation error plus the random error, as follows: \\[ \\begin{array}{ccccc} \\underbrace{y^{\\ast}-\\widehat{y}^{\\ast}} &amp; = &amp; \\underbrace{\\beta_0 - b_{0} + (\\beta_1 - b_{1})x_{\\ast 1} + \\cdots + (\\beta_k - b_{k})x_{\\ast k}} &amp; + &amp; \\underbrace{\\varepsilon ^{\\ast}} \\\\ {\\small \\text{prediction error}} &amp; {\\small =} &amp; {\\small \\text{error in estimating the} } &amp; {\\small +} &amp; {\\small \\text{additional} }\\\\ &amp; &amp; {\\small \\text{regression function at } x_{\\ast 1}, \\ldots, x_{\\ast k}} &amp; &amp; {\\small \\text{deviation} } \\end{array} \\] This decomposition allows us to provide a distribution for the prediction error. It is customary to assume approximate normality. With this additional assumption, we summarize this distribution using a prediction interval \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{y}_{\\ast} \\pm t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2} ~ se(pred), \\tag{6.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\[ se(pred) = s \\sqrt{1 + \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}^{\\prime }(\\mathbf{X}^{\\prime} \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{\\ast}}. \\] Here, the \\(t\\)-value \\(t_{n-(k+1),1-\\alpha /2}\\) is a percentile from the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-(k+1)\\) degrees of freedom. This extends equation (2.7). Communicating the range of likely outcomes is an important goal. When analyzing data, there may be several alternative prediction techniques available. Even within the class of regression models, each of several candidate models will produce a different prediction. It is important to provide a distribution, or range, of potential errors. Naive consumers can easily become disappointed with the results of predictions from regression models. These consumers are told (correctly) that the regression model is optimal, based on certain well-defined criteria, and are then provided with a point prediction, such as \\(\\hat{y}_{\\ast}\\). Without knowledge of an interval, the consumer has expectations for the performance of the prediction, usually higher than is warranted by information available in the sample. A prediction interval not only provides a single optimal point prediction but also a range of reliability. When making the predictions, there is an important assumption that the new observation follows the same model as that used in the sample. Thus, the basic conditions about the distribution of the errors should remain unchanged for new observations. It is also important that the level of the predictor variables, \\(x_{\\ast 1},\\ldots,x_{\\ast k}\\), be similar to those in the available sample. If one or several of the predictor variables differ dramatically from those in the available sample, then the resulting prediction can perform poorly. For example, it would be imprudent to use the model developed in Sections 2.1 through 2.3 to predict a region’s lottery with a population of \\(x_{\\ast}=400,000\\), over ten times the largest population in our sample. Even though it would be easy to plug \\(x_{\\ast}=400,000\\) into our formulas, the result would have little intuitive appeal. Extrapolating relationships beyond the observed data requires expertise with the nature of the data as well as the statistical methodology. In Section 6.3, we will identify this problem as a potential bias due to the sampling region. 6.2 The Importance of Variable Selection On one hand, choosing a theoretical model to represent precisely real-world events is probably an impossible task. On the other hand, choosing a model to represent approximately the real world is an important practical matter. The closer our model is to the real world, the more accurate are the statements that we make, suggested by the model. Although we cannot get the right model, we may be able to select a useful, or at least adequate, model. Users of statistics, from the raw beginner to the seasoned expert, will always select an inadequate model from time to time. The key question is: How important is it to select an adequate model? Although not every kind of mistake can be accounted for in advance, there are some guiding principles that are useful to keep in mind when selecting a model. 6.2.1 Overfitting the Model This type of mistake occurs when superfluous, or extraneous, variables are added to the specified model. If only a small number of extraneous variables, such as one or two, are added, then this type of error will probably not dramatically skew most of the types of conclusions that might be reached from the fitted model. For example, we know that when we add a variable to the model, the error sum of squares does not increase. If the variable is extraneous, then the error sum of squares will not get appreciably smaller either. In fact, adding an extraneous variable can increase \\(s^2\\) because the denominator is smaller by one degree of freedom. However, for data sets of moderate sample size, the effect is minimal. Adding several extraneous variables can inflate \\(s^{2}\\) appreciably, however. Further, there is the possibility that adding extraneous explanatory variables will induce, or worsen, the presence of collinearity. A more important point is that, by adding extraneous variables, our regression coefficient estimates remain unbiased. Consider the following example. Example: Regression using One Explanatory Variable. Assume that the true model of the responses is \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\varepsilon_i, \\quad i = 1, \\ldots, n. \\] Under this model, the level of a generic explanatory variable \\(x\\) does not affect the value of the response \\(y\\). If we were to predict the response at any level of \\(x\\), the prediction would have expected value \\(\\beta_0\\). However, suppose we mistakenly fit the model \\[ y_i = \\beta_0^{\\ast} + \\beta_1^{\\ast}x_i + \\varepsilon_i^{\\ast}. \\] With this model, the prediction at a generic level \\(x\\) is \\(b_{0}^{\\ast} + b_{1}^{\\ast}x\\) where \\(b_{0}^{\\ast}\\) and \\(b_{1}^{\\ast}\\) are the usual least squares estimates of \\(\\beta_0^{\\ast}\\) and \\(\\beta_1^{\\ast}\\), respectively. It is not too hard to confirm that \\[ \\text{Bias} = \\text{E}(b_{0}^{\\ast} + b_{1}^{\\ast}x) - \\text{E}y = 0, \\] where the expectations are calculated using the true model. Thus, by using a slightly larger model than we should have, we did not pay for it in terms of making a persistent, long-term error such as represented by the bias. The price of making this mistake is that our standard error is slightly higher than it would be if we had chosen the correct model. 6.2.2 Underfitting the Model This type of error occurs when important variables are omitted from the model specification; it is more serious than overfitting. Omitting important variables can cause appreciable amounts of bias in our resulting estimates. Further, because of the bias, the resulting estimates of \\(s^{2}\\) are larger than need be. A larger \\(s\\) inflates our prediction intervals and produces inaccurate tests of hypotheses concerning the importance of explanatory variables. To see the effects of underfitting a model, we return to the previous example. Example: Regression using One Explanatory Variable - Continued. We now reverse the roles of the models described before. Assume that the true model is \\[ y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i \\] and that we mistakenly fit the model, \\[ y_i = \\beta_0^{\\ast} + \\varepsilon_i^{\\ast}. \\] Thus, we have inadvertently omitted the effects of the explanatory variable \\(x\\). With the fitted model, we would use \\(\\bar{y}\\) for our prediction at a generic level of \\(x\\). From the true model, we have \\(\\bar{y} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\bar{x} + \\bar{\\varepsilon}\\). The bias of the prediction at \\(x\\) is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Bias} &amp;= \\text{E} \\bar{y} - \\text{E} (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon) \\\\ &amp;= \\text{E} (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\bar{x} + \\bar{\\varepsilon}) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x) \\\\ &amp;= \\beta_1 (\\bar{x} - x). \\end{array} \\] If \\(\\beta_1\\) is positive, then we under-predict for large values of \\(x\\), resulting in a negative bias, and over-predict for small values of \\(x\\) (relative to \\(\\overline{x}\\)). Thus, there is a persistent, long-term error in omitting the explanatory variable \\(x\\). Similarly, one can check that this type of error produces biased regression parameter estimates and an inflated value of \\(s^{2}\\). Of course, no one wants to overfit or underfit the model. However, data from the social sciences are often messy and it can be hard to know whether or not to include a variable in the model. When selecting variables, analysts are often guided by the principle of parsimony, also known as Occam’s Razor, which states that when there are several possible explanations for a phenomenon, use the simplest. There are several arguments for preferring simpler models: A simpler explanation is easier to interpret. Simple models, also known as “parsimonious” models, often do well on fitting out-of-sample data. Extraneous variables can cause problems of collinearity, leading to difficulty in interpreting individual coefficients. The contrasting viewpoint can be summarized in a quote often attributed to Albert Einstein, that states that we should use “the simplest model possible, but no simpler.” This section demonstrates that underfitting a model, by omitting important variables, is typically a more serious error than including extraneous variables that add little to our ability to explain the data. Including extraneous variables decreases the degrees of freedom and increases the estimate of variability, typically of less concern in actuarial applications. When in doubt, leave the variable in. 6.3 The Importance of Data Collection The regression modeling process starts with collecting data. Having studied the results, and the variable selection process, we can now discuss the inputs to the process. Not surprisingly, there is a long list of potential pitfalls that are frequently encountered when collecting regression data. In this section, we identify the major potential pitfalls and provide some avenues for avoiding these pitfalls. 6.3.1 Sampling Frame Error and Adverse Selection Sampling frame error occurs when the sampling frame, the list from which the sample is drawn, is not an adequate approximation of the population of interest. In the end, a sample must be a representative subset of a larger population, or universe, of interest. If the sample is not representative, taking a larger sample does not eliminate bias; you simply repeat the same mistake over again and again. Example: Literary Digest Poll. Perhaps the most widely known example of sampling frame error is from the 1936 Literary Digest poll. This poll was conducted to predict the winner of the 1936 U.S. Presidential election. The two leading candidates were Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Democrat, and Alfred Landon, the Republican. Literary Digest, a prominent magazine at the time, conducted a survey of ten million voters. Of those polled, 2.4 million responded, predicting a “landslide” Landon victory by a 57% to 43% margin. However, the actual election resulted in an overwhelming Roosevelt victory, by a 62% to 38% margin. What went wrong? There were a number of problems with the Literary Digest survey. Perhaps the most important was the sampling frame error. To develop their sampling frame, Literary Digest used addresses from telephone books and membership lists of clubs. In 1936, the United States was in the depths of the Great Depression; telephones and club memberships were a luxury that only upper income individuals could afford. Thus, Literary Digest’s list included an unrepresentative number of upper income individuals. In previous presidential elections conducted by Literary Digest, the rich and poor tended to vote along similar lines and this was not a problem. However, economic problems were top political issues in the 1936 Presidential election. As it turned out, the poor tended to vote for Roosevelt and the rich tended to vote for Landon. As a result, the Literary Digest poll results were grossly mistaken. Taking a large sample, even of size 2.4 million, did not help; the basic mistake was repeated over and over again. Sampling frame bias occurs when the sample is not a representative subset of the population of interest. When analyzing insurance company data, this bias can arise due to adverse selection. In many insurance markets, companies design and price contracts and policyholders decide whether or not to enter a contractual agreement (actually, policyholders “apply” for insurance so that insurers also have a right not to enter into the agreement). Thus, someone is more likely to enter into an agreement if they believe that the insurer is underpricing their risk, especially in light of policyholder characteristics that are not observed by the insurer. For example, it is well known that mortality experience of a sample of purchasers of life annuities is not representative of the overall population; people who purchase annuities tend to be healthy relative to the overall population. You would not purchase a life annuity that pays a periodic benefit while living if you were in poor health and thought that your probability of a long life to be low. Adverse selection arises because “bad risks,” those with higher than expected claims, are more likely to enter into contracts than corresponding “good risks.” Here, the expectation is developed based on characteristics (explanatory variables) that can be observed by the insurer. Of course, there is a large market for annuities and other forms of insurance in which adverse selection exists. Insurance companies can price these markets appropriately by redefining their “population of interest” to be not the general population but rather the population of potential policyholders. Thus, for example, in pricing annuities, insurers use annuitant mortality data, not data for the overall population. In this way, they can avoid potential mismatches between the population and sample. More generally, the experience of almost any company differs from the overall population due to underwriting standards and sales philosophies. Some companies seek “preferred risks” by offering educational discounts, good driving bonuses and so forth, whereas others seek high risk insureds. The company’s sample of insureds will differ from the overall population and the extent of the difference can be an interesting aspect to quantify in an analysis. Sampling frame bias can be particularly important when a company seeks to market a new product for which it has no experience data. Identifying a target market and its relation to the overall population is an important aspect of a market development plan. 6.3.2 Limited Sampling Regions A limited sampling region can give rise to potential bias when we try to extrapolate outside of the sampling region. To illustrate, consider Figure 6.1. Here, based on the data in the sampling region, a line may seem to be an appropriate representation. However, if a quadratic curve is the true expected response, any forecast that is far from the sampling region will be seriously biased. Figure 6.1: Extrapolation outside of the sampling region may be biased Another pitfall due to a limited sampling region, although not a bias, that can arise is the difficulty in estimating a regression coefficient. In Chapter 5, we saw that a smaller spread of a variable, other things equal, means a less reliable estimate of the slope coefficient associated with that variable. That is, from Section 5.5.2 or equation (6.1), we see that the smaller is the spread of \\(x_{j}\\), as measured by \\(s_{x_{j}}\\), the larger is the standard error of \\(b_{j},se(b_{j})\\). Taken to the extreme, where \\(s_{x_{j}}=0\\), we might have a situation such as illustrated in Figure 6.2. For the extreme situation illustrated in Figure 6.2, there is not enough variation in \\(x\\) to estimate the corresponding slope parameter. Figure 6.2: The lack of variation in \\(x\\) means that we cannot fit a unique line relating \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). 6.3.3 Limited Dependent Variables, Censoring and Truncation In some applications, the dependent variable is constrained to fall within certain regions. To see why this is a problem, first recall that under the linear regression model, the dependent variable equals the regression function plus a random error. Typically, the random error is assumed to be approximately normally distributed, so that the response varies continuously. However, if the outcomes of the dependent variable are restricted, or limited, then the outcomes are not purely continuous. This means that our assumption of normal errors is not strictly correct, and may not even be a good approximation. To illustrate, Figure 6.3 shows a plot of individual’s income (\\(x\\)) versus amount of insurance purchased (\\(y\\)). The sample in this plot represents two subsamples, those who purchased insurance, corresponding to \\(y&gt;0\\), and those who did not, corresponding to “price” \\(y=0\\). Fitting a single line to these data would misinform users about the effects of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\). Figure 6.3: When individuals do not purchase anything, they are recorded as \\(y=0\\) sales. Figure 6.4: If the responses below the horizontal line at \\(y=d\\) are omitted, then the fitted regression line can be very different from the true regression line. If we dealt with only those who purchased insurance then we still would have an implicit lower bound of zero (if an insurance price must exceed zero). However, prices need be close to this bound for a given sampling region and thus not represent an important practical problem. By including several individuals who did not purchase insurance (and thus spent $0 on insurance), our sampling region now clearly includes this lower bound. There are several ways in which dependent variables can be restricted, or censored. Figure 6.3 illustrates the case in which the value of \\(y\\) may be no lower than zero. As another example, insurance claims are often restricted to be less than or equal to an upper limit specified in the insurance policy. If censoring is severe, ordinary least squares produces biased results. Specialized approaches, known as censored regression models, are described in Chapter 15 to handle this problem. Figure 6.4 illustrates another commonly encountered limitation on the value of the dependent variable. For this illustration, suppose that \\(y\\) represents an insured loss and that \\(d\\) represents the deductible on an insurance policy. In this scenario, it is common practice for insurers to not record losses below \\(d\\) (they are typically not reported by policyholders). In this case, the data are said to be truncated. Not surprisingly, truncated regression models are available to handle this situation. As a rule of thumb, truncated data represent a more serious source of bias than censored data. When data are truncated, we do not have values of dependent variables and thus have less information than when the data are censored. See Chapter 15 for further discussion. 6.3.4 Omitted and Endogenous Variables Of course, analysts prefer to include all important variables. However, a common problem is that we may not have the resources nor the foresight to gather and analyze all the relevant data. Further, sometimes we are prohibited from including variables. For example, in insurance rating we are typically precluded from using ethnicity as a rating variable. Further, there are many mortality and other decrement tables that are “uni-sex,” that is, blind to gender. Omitting important variables can affect our ability to fit the regression function; this can affect in-sample (explanation) as well as out-of-sample (prediction) performance. If the omitted variable is uncorrelated with other explanatory variables, then the omission will not affect estimation of regression coefficients. Typically this is not the case. The Section 3.4.3 Refrigerator Example illustrates a serious case where the direction of a statistically significant result was reversed based on the presence of an explanatory variable. In this example, we found that a cross-section of refrigerators displayed a significantly positive correlation between price and the annual energy cost of operating the refrigerator. This positive correlation was counter-intuitive because we would hope that higher prices would mean lower annual expenditures in operating a refrigerator. However, when we included several additional variables, in particular, measures of the size of a refrigerator, we found a significantly negative relationship between price and energy costs. Again, by omitting these additional variables, there was an important bias when using regression to understand the relationship between price and energy costs. Omitted variables can lead to the presence of endogenous explanatory variables. An exogenous variable is one that can be taken as “given” for the purposes at hand. An endogenous variable is one that fails the exogeneity requirement. An omitted variable can affect both the \\(y\\) and the \\(x\\) and in this sense induce a relationship between the two variables. If the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is due to an omitted variable, it is difficult to condition on the \\(x\\) when estimating a model for \\(y\\). Up to now, the explanatory variables have been treated as non-stochastic. For many social science applications, it is more intuitive to consider the \\(x\\)’s to be stochastic, and perform inference conditional on their realizations. For example, under common sampling schemes, we can estimate the conditional regression function \\[ \\mathrm{E~}\\left(y|x_1, \\ldots, x_k \\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\ldots + \\beta_k x_k . \\] This is known as a “sampling-based” model. In the economics literature, Goldberger (1972) defines a structural model as a stochastic model representing a causal relationship, not a relationship that simply captures statistical associations. Structural models can readily contain endogenous explanatory variables. To illustrate, we consider an example relating claims and premiums. For many lines of business, premium classes are simply nonlinear functions of exogenous factors such as age, gender and so forth. For other lines of business, premiums charged are a function of prior claims history. Consider model equations that relate one’s claims (\\(y_{it}, t=1, 2\\)) to premiums (\\(x_{it}, t=1, 2\\)): \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} y_{i2} = \\beta_{0,C} + \\beta_{1,C} y_{i1} + \\beta_{2,C} x_{i2} + \\varepsilon_{i1} \\\\ x_{i2} = \\beta_{0,P} + \\beta_{1,P} y_{i1} + \\beta_{2,P} x_{i1} +\\varepsilon_{i2} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] In this model, current period (\\(t=2\\)) claims and premiums are affected by the prior period’s claims and premiums. This is an example of a structural equations model that requires special estimation techniques. Our usual estimation procedures are biased! Example: Race, Redlining and Automobile Insurance Prices - Continued. Although Harrington and Niehaus (1998) did not find racial discrimination in insurance pricing, their results on access to insurance were inconclusive. Insurers offer “standard” and “preferred” risk contracts to applicants that meet restrictive underwriting standards, as compared to “substandard” risk contracts where underwriting standards are more relaxed. Expected claims are lower for standard and preferred risk contracts, and so premiums are lower, than substandard contracts. Harrington and Niehaus examined the proportion of applicants offered substandard contracts, NSSHARE, and found it significantly positively related to PCTBLACK, the proportion of population black. This suggests evidence of racial discrimination; they state this to be an inappropriate interpretation due to omitted variable bias. Harrington and Niehaus argue that the proportion of applicants offered substandard contracts should be positively related to expected claim costs. Further, expected claim costs are strongly related to PCTBLACK, because minorities in the sample tended to be lower income. Thus, unobserved variables such as income tend to drive the positive relationship between NSSHARE and PCTBLACK. Because the data are analyzed at the zip code level and not at the individual level, the potential omitted variable bias rendered the analysis inconclusive. 6.3.5 Missing Data In the data examples, illustrations, case studies and exercises of this text, there are many instances where certain data are unavailable for analysis, or missing. In every instance, the data were not carelessly lost but were unavailable due to substantive reasons associated with the data collection. For example, when we examined stock returns from a cross-section of companies, we saw that some companies did not have an average five year earnings per share figure. The reason was simply that they had not been in existence for five years. As another example, when examining life expectancies, some countries did not report the total fertility rate because they lacked administrative resources to capture this data. Missing data are an inescapable aspect of analyzing data in the social sciences. When the reason for the lack of availability of data is unrelated to actual data values, the data are said to be missing at random. There are a variety of techniques for handling missing at random data, none of which are clearly superior to the others. One “technique” is to simply ignore the problem. Hence, missing at random is sometimes called the ignorable case of missing data. If there are only a few missing data, compared to the total number available, a widely employed strategy is to delete the observations corresponding to the missing data. Assuming that the data are missing at random, little information is lost by deleting a small portion of the data. Further, with this strategy, we need not make additional assumptions about the relationships among the data. If the missing data are primarily from one variable, we can consider omitting this variable. Here, the motivation is that we lose less information when omitting this variable as compared to retaining the variable but losing the observations associated with the missing data. Another strategy is to fill in, or impute, missing data. There are many variations of the imputation strategy. All assume some type of relationships among the variables in addition to the regression model assumptions. Although these methods yield reasonable results, note that any type of filled-in values do not yield the same inherent variability as the real data. Thus, results of analyses based on imputed values often reflect less variability than those with real data. Example: Insurance Company Expenses - Continued. When examining company financial information, analysts commonly are forced to omit substantial amounts of information when using regression models to search for relationships. To illustrate, Segal (2002) examined life insurance financial statements from data provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). He initially considered 733 firm-year observations over the period 1995-1998. However, 154 observations were excluded because of inconsistent or negative premiums, benefits and other important explanatory variables. Small companies representing 131 observations were also excluded. Small companies consist of fewer than 10 employees and agents, operating costs less than $1 million or fewer than 1,000 life policies sold. The resulting sample was \\(n=448\\) observations. The sample restrictions were based on explanatory variables - this procedure does not necessarily bias results. Segal argued that his final sample remained representative of the population of interest. There were about 110 firms in each of 1995-1998. In 1998, aggregate assets of the firms in the sample represent approximately $650 billion, a third of the life insurance industry. 6.4 Missing Data Models To understand the mechanisms that lead to unplanned nonresponse, we model it stochastically. Let \\(r_i\\) be a binary variable for the \\(i\\)th observation, with a one indicating that this response is observed and a zero indicating that the response is missing. Let \\(\\mathbf{r} = (r_1, \\ldots, r_n)^{\\prime}\\) summarize the data availability for all subjects. The interest is in whether or not the responses influence the missing data mechanism. For notation, we use \\(\\mathbf{Y} = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)^{\\prime}\\) to be the collection of all potentially observed responses. 6.4.1 Missing at Random In the case where \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) does not affect the distribution of \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), we follow Rubin (1976) and call this case missing completely at random (MCAR). Specifically, the missing data are MCAR if \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y}) = \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r})\\), where f(.) is a generic probability mass function. An extension of this idea is in Little (1995), where the adjective “covariate dependent” is added when \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) does not affect the distribution of \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), conditional on the covariates. If the covariates are summarized as \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), then the condition corresponds to the relation \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y, X}) = \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r | X})\\). To illustrate this point, consider an example of Little and Rubin (1987) where \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) corresponds to age and \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) corresponds to income of all potential observations. If the probability of being missing does not depend on income, then the missing data are MCAR. If the probability of being missing varies by age but does not by income over observations within an age group, then the missing data are covariate dependent MCAR. Under the latter specification, it is possible for the missing data to vary by income. For example, younger people may be less likely to respond to a survey. This shows that the “missing at random” feature depends on the purpose of the analysis. Specifically, it is possible that an analysis of the joint effects of age and income may encounter serious patterns of missing data whereas an analysis of income controlled for age suffers no serious bias patterns. Little and Rubin (1987) advocate modeling the missing data mechanisms. To illustrate, consider a likelihood approach using a selection model for the missing data mechanism. Now, partition \\(\\mathbf{Y}\\) into observed and missing components using the notation \\(\\mathbf{Y} =\\{\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\mathbf{Y}_{miss}\\}\\). With the likelihood approach, we base inference on the observed random variables. Thus, we use a likelihood proportional to the joint function \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Y}_{obs})\\). We also specify a selection model by specifying the conditional mass function \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y})\\). Suppose that the observed responses and the selection model distributions are characterized by vectors of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\psi\\) , respectively. Then, with the relation \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Y}_{obs},\\boldsymbol \\theta, \\boldsymbol \\psi)\\) \\(= \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\theta) \\times \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\psi)\\), we may express the log likelihood of the observed random variables as \\[ L(\\boldsymbol \\theta, \\boldsymbol \\psi) = \\mathrm{ln~} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\theta, \\boldsymbol \\psi) = \\mathrm{ln~} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\theta) + \\mathrm{ln~} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\psi). \\] (See Section 11.9 if you would like a refresher on likelihood inference.) In the case where the data are MCAR, then \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\boldsymbol \\psi) = \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\boldsymbol \\psi)\\) does not depend on \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}\\). Little and Rubin (1987) also consider the case where the selection mechanism model distribution does not depend on \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{miss}\\) but may depend on \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}\\). In this case, they call the data missing at random (MAR). In both the MAR and MCAR cases, we see that the likelihood may be maximized over the parameters, separately for each case. In particular, if one is only interested in the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), then the selection model mechanism may be “ignored.” Hence, both situations are often referred to as the ignorable case. Example: Dental Expenditures. Let \\(y\\) represent a household’s annual dental expenditure and \\(x\\) represent income. Consider the following five selection mechanisms. The household is not selected (missing) with probability without regard to the level of dental expenditure. In this case, the selection mechanism is MCAR. The household is not selected if the dental expenditure is less than $100. In this case, the selection mechanism depends on the observed and missing response. The selection mechanism cannot be ignored. The household is not selected if the income is less than $20,000. In this case, the selection mechanism is MCAR, covariate dependent. That is, assuming that the purpose of the analysis is to understand dental expenditures conditional on knowledge of income, stratifying based on income does not seriously bias the analysis. The probability of a household being selected increases with dental expenditure. For example, suppose the probability of being selected is a linear function of \\(\\exp(\\psi y_i)/(1+ \\exp(\\psi y_i))\\). In this case, the selection mechanism depends on the observed and missing response. The selection mechanism cannot be ignored. The household is followed over \\(T\\) = 2 periods. In the second period, a household is not selected if the first period expenditure is less than $100. In this case, the selection mechanism is MAR. That is, the selection mechanism is based on an observed response. The second and fourth selection mechanisms represent situations where the selection mechanism must be explicitly modeled; these are non-ignorable cases. In these situations without explicit adjustments, procedures that ignore the selection effect may produce seriously biased results. To illustrate a correction for selection bias in a simple case, we outline an example due to Little and Rubin (1987). Section 6.4.2 describes additional mechanisms. Example: Historical Heights. Little and Rubin (1987) discuss data due to Wachter and Trusell (1982) on \\(y\\), the height of men recruited to serve in the military. The sample is subject to censoring in that minimum height standards were imposed for admission to the military. Thus, the selection mechanism is \\[ r_i = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; y_i &gt; c_i \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathrm{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. , \\] where \\(c_i\\) is the known minimum height standard imposed at the time of recruitment. The selection mechanism is non-ignorable because it depends on the individual’s height, \\(y\\). For this example, additional information is available to provide reliable model inference. Specifically, based on other studies of male heights, we may assume that the population of heights is normally distributed. Thus, the likelihood of the observables can be written down and inference may proceed directly. To illustrate, suppose that \\(c_i = c\\) is constant. Let \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\) denote the mean and standard deviation of \\(y\\). Further suppose that we have a random sample of \\(n + m\\) men in which \\(m\\) men fall below the minimum standard height \\(c\\) and we observe \\(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs} = (y_1, \\ldots, y_n)^{\\prime}\\). The joint distribution for observables is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\mu, \\sigma) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\mu, \\sigma) \\times \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r} | \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\left\\{ \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{f}(y_i | y_i &gt; c) \\times \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i &gt; c) \\right\\} \\times \\left\\{\\mathrm{Pr}(y_i \\leq c)\\right\\}^m. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Now, let \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\Phi\\) represent the density and distribution function for the standard normal distribution. Thus, the log-likelihood is \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\mu, \\sigma) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{ln~} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Y}_{obs}, \\mu, \\sigma) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{ln}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\phi \\left( \\frac{y_i-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\right\\} + m~ \\mathrm{ln}\\left\\{ \\Phi \\left( \\frac{c-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right) \\right\\} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This is easy to maximize in \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma\\). If one ignored the censoring mechanisms, then one would derive estimates of the observed data from the “log likelihood,” \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{ln}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\phi \\left( \\frac{y_i-\\mu}{\\sigma} \\right) \\right\\}, \\] yielding different, and biased, results. 6.4.2 Non-Ignorable Missing Data For non-ignorable missing data, Little (1995) recommends: Avoid missing responses whenever possible by using appropriate follow-up procedures. Collect covariates that are useful for predicting missing values. Collect as much information as possible regarding the nature of the missing data mechanism. For the last point, if little is known about the missing data mechanism, then it is difficult to employ a robust statistical procedure to correct for the selection bias. There are many models of missing data mechanisms. A general overview appears in Little and Rubin (1987). Little (1995) surveys the problem of attrition. Rather than survey this developing literature, we give a widely used model of non-ignorable missing data. Heckman Two-Stage Procedure Heckman (1976) assumes that the sampling response mechanism is governed by the latent (unobserved) variable \\(r_i^{\\ast}\\) where \\[ r_i^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\gamma + \\eta_i. \\] The variables in \\(\\mathbf{z}_i\\) may or may not include the variables in \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\). We observe \\(y_i\\) if \\(r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0\\), that is, if \\(r_i^{\\ast}\\) crosses the threshold 0. Thus, we observe \\[ r_i = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathrm{otherwise} \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. . \\] To complete the specification, we assume that {(\\(\\varepsilon_i,\\eta_i\\))} are identically and independently distributed, and that the joint distribution of (\\(\\varepsilon_i,\\eta_i\\)) is bivariate normal with means zero, variances \\(\\sigma^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_{\\eta}^2\\) and correlation \\(\\rho\\). Note that if the correlation parameter \\(\\rho\\) equals zero, then the response and selection models are independent. In this case, the data are MCAR and the usual estimation procedures are unbiased and asymptotically efficient. Under these assumptions, basic multivariate normal calculations show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~}(y_i | r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0) = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\beta_{\\lambda} \\lambda(\\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\gamma), \\] where \\(\\beta_{\\lambda} = \\rho \\sigma\\) and \\(\\lambda(a)=\\phi(a)/\\Phi(a)\\). Here, \\(\\lambda(.)\\) is the inverse of the so-called “Mills ratio.” This calculation suggests the following two-step procedure for estimating the parameters of interest. Heckman’s Two-Stage Procedure Use the data {(\\(r_i, \\mathbf{z}_i\\))} and a probit regression model to estimate \\(\\boldsymbol \\gamma\\). Call this estimator \\(\\mathbf{g}_H\\). Use the estimator from stage (1) to create a new explanatory variable, \\(x_{i,K+1} = \\lambda(\\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime}\\mathbf{g}_H)\\). Run a regression model using the \\(K\\) explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) as well as the additional explanatory variable \\(x_{i,K+1}\\). Use \\(\\mathbf{b}_H\\) and \\(b_{\\lambda,H}\\) to denote the estimators of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) and \\(\\beta_{\\lambda}\\), respectively. Chapter 11 will introduce probit regressions. We also note that the two-step method does not work in absence of covariates to predict the response and, for practical purposes, requires variables in \\(\\mathbf{z}\\) that are not in \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) (see Little and Rubin, 1987). To test for selection bias, we may test the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\beta_{\\lambda}=0\\) in the second stage due to the relation \\(\\beta_{\\lambda}= \\rho \\sigma\\). When conducting this test, one should use heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors. This is because the conditional variance \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y_i | r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0)\\) depends on the observation \\(i\\). Specifically, \\(\\mathrm{Var}(y_i | r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0) = \\sigma^2 (1-\\rho^2 \\delta_i),\\) where \\(\\delta_i= \\lambda_i(\\lambda_i + \\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\gamma)\\) and \\(\\lambda_i = \\phi(\\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\gamma)/\\Phi(\\mathbf{z}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\gamma).\\) This procedure assumes normality for the selection latent variables to form the augmented variables. Other distribution forms are available in the literature, including the logistic and uniform distributions. A deeper criticism, raised by Little (1985), is that the procedure relies heavily on assumptions that cannot be tested using the data available. This criticism is analogous to the historical heights example where we relied heavily on the normal curve to infer the distribution of heights below the censoring point. Despite these criticisms, Heckman’s procedure is widely used in the social sciences. EM algorithm Section 6.4.2 has focused on introducing specific models of non-ignorable nonresponse. General robust models of nonresponse are not available. Rather, a more appropriate strategy is to focus on a specific situation, collect as much information as possible regarding the nature of the selection problem and then develop a model for this specific selection problem. The EM algorithm is a computational device for computing model parameters. Although specific to each model, it has found applications in a wide variety of models involving missing data. Computationally, the algorithm iterates between the “E,” for conditional expectation, and “M,” for maximization, steps. The E step finds the conditional expectation of the missing data given the observed data and current values of the estimated parameters. This is analogous to the time-honored tradition of imputing missing data. A key innovation of the EM algorithm is that one imputes sufficient statistics for missing values, not the individual data points. For the M step, one updates parameter estimates by maximizing an observed log likelihood. Both the sufficient statistics and the log likelihood depend on the model specification. Many introductions of the EM algorithm are available in the literature. Little and Rubin (1987) provide a detailed treatment. 6.5 Application: Risk Managers’ Cost Effectiveness This section examines data from a survey on the cost effectiveness of risk management practices. Risk management practices are activities undertaken by a firm to minimize the potential cost of future losses, such as the event of a fire in a warehouse or an accident that injures employees. This section develops a model that can be used to make statements about cost of managing risks. An outline of the regression modeling process is as follows. We begin by providing an introduction to the problem and giving some brief background on the data. Certain prior theories will lead us to present a preliminary model fit. Using diagnostic techniques, it will be evident that several assumptions underpinning this model are not in accord with the data. This will lead us to go back to the beginning and start the analysis from scratch. Things that we learn from a detailed examination of the data will lead us to postulate some revised models. Finally, to communicate certain aspects of the new model, we will explore graphical presentations of the recommended model. Introduction The data for this study were provided by Professor Joan Schmit and are discussed in more detail in the paper, “Cost effectiveness of risk management practices,” Schmit and Roth (1990). The data are from a questionnaire that was sent to 374 risk managers of large U.S.-based organizations. The purpose of the study was to relate cost effectiveness to management’s philosophy of controlling the company’s exposure to various property and casualty losses, after adjusting for company effects such as size and industry type. First, some caveats. Survey data are often based on samples of convenience, not probability samples. Just as with all observational data sets, regression methodology is a useful tool for summarizing data. However, we must be careful when making inferences based on this type of data set. For this particular survey, 162 managers returned completed surveys resulting in a good response rate of \\(43\\%\\). However, for the variables included in the analysis (defined below), only 73 forms were completed resulting in a complete response rate of \\(20\\%\\). Why such a dramatic difference? Managers, like most people, typically do not mind responding to queries about their attitudes, or opinions, about various issues. When questioned about hard facts, in this case company asset size or insurance premiums, either they considered the information proprietary and were reluctant to respond even when guaranteed anonymity or they simply were not willing to take the time to look up the information. From a surveyor’s standpoint, this is unfortunate because typically “attitudinal” data are fuzzy (high variance compared to the mean) as compared to hard financial data. The tradeoff is that the latter data are often hard to obtain. In fact, for this survey, several pre-questionnaires were sent to ascertain managers’ willingness to answer specific questions. From the pre-questionnaires, the researchers severely reduced the number of financial questions that they intended to ask. A measure of risk management cost effectiveness, FIRMCOST, is the dependent variable. This variable is defined as total property and casualty premiums and uninsured losses as a percentage of total assets. It is a proxy for annual expenditures associated with insurable events, standardized by company size. Here, for the financial variables, ASSUME is the per occurrence retention amount as a percentage of total assets, CAP indicates whether the company owns a captive insurance company, SIZELOG is the logarithm of total assets and INDCOST is a measure of the firm’s industry risk. Attitudinal variables include CENTRAL, a measure of the importance of the local managers in choosing the amount of risk to be retained and SOPH, a measure of the degree of importance in using analytical tools, such as regression, in making risk management decisions. In the paper, the researchers described several weaknesses of the definitions used but argue that these definitions provide useful information, based on the willingness of risk managers to obtain reliable information. The researchers also described several theories concerning relationships that may be confirmed by the data. Specifically, they hypothesized: There exists an inverse relationship between the risk retention (ASSUME) and cost (FIRMCOST). The idea behind this theory is that larger retention amounts should mean lower expenses to a firm, resulting in lower costs. The use of a captive insurance company (CAP) results in lower costs. Presumably, a captive is used only when cost effective and consequently, this variable should indicate lower costs if used effectively. There exists an inverse relationship between the measure of centralization (CENTRAL) and cost (FIRMCOST). Presumably, local managers would be able to make more cost-effective decisions because they are more familiar with local circumstances regarding risk management than centrally located managers. There exists an inverse relationship between the measure of sophistication (SOPH) and cost (FIRMCOST). Presumably, more sophisticated analytical tools help firms to manage risk better, resulting in lower costs. Preliminary Analysis To test the theories described above, the regression analysis framework can be used. To do this, posit the model \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{FIRMCOST} &amp;=&amp;\\beta_0 +\\beta_1 \\text{ ASSUME}+\\beta_{2}\\text{ CAP} +\\beta_{3}\\text{ SIZELOG}+\\beta_4\\text{ INDCOST} \\\\ &amp;&amp;+\\beta_5\\text{ CENTRAL}+\\beta_6\\text{ SOPH}+ \\varepsilon. \\end{array} } \\] With this model, each theory can be interpreted in terms of regression coefficients. For example, \\(\\beta_1\\) can be interpreted as the expected change in cost per unit change in retention level (ASSUME). Thus, if the first hypothesis is true, we expect \\(\\beta_1\\) to be negative. To test this, we can estimate \\(b_{1}\\) and use our tests of hypotheses machinery to decide if \\(b_{1}\\) is significantly less than zero. The variables SIZELOG and INDCOST are included in the model to control for the effects of these variables. These variables are not directly under a risk manager’s control and thus are not of primary interest. However, inclusion of these variables can account for an important part of the variability. Data from 73 managers was fit using this regression model. Table 6.2 summarizes the fitted model. Table 6.2: Regression Results from a Preliminary Model Fit Coefficient Standard Error \\(t\\)-Statistic (Intercept) 59.765 19.065 3.135 ASSUME -0.300 0.222 -1.353 CAP 5.498 3.848 1.429 SIZELOG -6.836 1.923 -3.555 INDCOST 23.078 8.304 2.779 CENTRAL 0.133 1.441 0.092 SOPH -0.137 0.347 -0.394 The adjusted coefficient of determination is \\(R_{a}^{2}=18.8\\%\\), the \\(F\\)-ratio is 3.78 and the residual standard deviation is \\(s=14.56\\). On the basis of the summary statistics from the regression model, we can conclude that the measures of centralization and sophistication do not have an impact on our measure of cost effectiveness. For both of these variables the \\(t\\)-ratio is low, less than 1.0 in absolute value. The effect of risk retention seems only somewhat important. The coefficient has the appropriate sign although is only 1.35 standard errors below zero. This would not be considered statistically significant at the 5% level, although it would be at the 10% level (the \\(p\\)-value is 9%). Perhaps most perplexing is the coefficient associated with the CAP variable. We theorized that this coefficient would be negative. However, in our analysis of the data, the coefficient turns out to be positive and is 1.43 standard errors above zero. This not only leads us to disaffirm our theory, but also to search for new ideas that are in accord with the information learned from the data. Schmit and Roth suggest reasons that may help us interpret the results of our hypothesis testing procedures. For example, they suggest that managers in the sample may not have the most sophisticated tools available to them when managing risks, resulting in an insignificant coefficient associated with SOPH. They also discussed alternative suggestions, as well as interpretations for the other results of the tests of hypotheses. How robust is this model? Section 6.2 emphasized some of the dangers of working with an inadequate model. Some readers may feel uncomfortable with the model selected above because two out of the six variables have \\(t\\)-ratios less than 1 in absolute value and four out of six have \\(t\\)-ratios less than 1.5 in absolute value. Perhaps even more important, histograms of the standardized residuals and leverages, in Figure 6.5, show several observations to be outliers and high leverage points. To illustrate, the largest residual turns out to be \\(e_{15}=83.73\\). The error sum of squares is \\(Error~SS\\) = \\((n-(k+1))s^{2}\\) = \\((73-7)(14.56)^{2}=13,987\\). Thus, the 15th observation represents 50.1% of the error sum of squares \\((=83.73^{2}/13,987)\\), suggesting that this 1 observation out of 73 has a dominant impact on the model fit. Further, plots of standardized residuals versus fitted values, not presented here, displayed evidence of heteroscedastic residuals. Based on these observations, it seems reasonable to assess the robustness of the model. Figure 6.5: Histograms of standardized residuals and leverages from a preliminary regression model fit.

From Table 6.3, the largest value of FIRMCOST is 97.55, which is more than five standard deviations above the mean \\([10.97+5(16.16)=91.77]\\). An examination of the data shows that this point is observation 15, the same observation that was an outlier in the preliminary regression fit. However, the histogram of FIRMCOST in Figure 6.6 reveals that this is not the only unusual point. Two other observations have unusually large values of FIRMCOST, resulting in a distribution that is skewed to the right. The histogram, in Figure 6.6, of the ASSUME variable shows that this distribution is also skewed to the right, possibly due solely to two large observations. From the basic summary statistics in Table 6.3, we see that the largest value of ASSUME is more than seven standard deviations above the mean. This observation may well turn out to be influential in subsequent regression model fitting. The scatterplot of FIRMCOST versus ASSUME in Figure 6.6 tells us that the observation with the largest value of FIRMCOST is not the same as the observation with the largest value of ASSUME. Table 6.3: Summary Statistics of \\(n=73\\) Risk Management Surveys Mean Median Standard Deviation Minimum Maximum FIRMCOST 10.973 6.08 16.159 0.20 97.55 ASSUME 2.574 0.51 8.445 0.00 61.82 CAP 0.342 0.00 0.478 0.00 1.00 SIZELOG 8.332 8.27 0.963 5.27 10.60 INDCOST 0.418 0.34 0.216 0.09 1.22 CENTRAL 2.247 2.00 1.256 1.00 5.00 SOPH 21.192 23.00 5.304 5.00 31.00 Source: Schmit and Roth, (1990) From the histograms of SIZELOG, INDCOST, CENTRAL, and SOPH, we see that these distributions are not heavily skewed. Taking logarithms of the size of total company assets has served to make the distribution more symmetric than in the original units. From the histogram and summary statistics, we see that CENTRAL is a discrete variables, taking on values one through five. The other discrete variable is CAP, a binary variable taking values only zero and one. The histogram and scatter plot corresponding to CAP is not presented here. It is more informative to provide a table of means of each variable by levels of CAP, as in Table 6.4. From this table, we see that 25 of the 73 companies surveyed own captive insurers. Further, on one hand, the average FIRMCOST for those companies with captive insurers \\((\\)CAP \\(=1)\\) is larger than those without \\((\\)CAP \\(=0)\\). On the other hand, when moving to the logarithmic scale, the opposite is true; that is, average COSTLOG for those companies with captive insurers \\((\\)CAP \\(=1)\\) is larger than those without \\((\\)CAP \\(=0)\\).

There is an inverse relationship between FIRMCOST and SIZELOG, and the scatterplot plot suggests this relationship may be nonlinear. There is also a mild positive relationship between FIRMCOST and INDCOST and no apparent relationships between FIRMCOST and any of the other explanatory variables. These observations are reinforced by the table of correlations given in Table 6.4. Note that the table masks a feature that is evident in the scatter plots, the effect of the unusually large observations.

Figure 6.7 is the histogram of COSTLOG, defined to be the logarithm of FIRMCOST. The distribution is much less skewed than the distribution of FIRMCOST. The variable COSTLOG was also included in the correlation matrix in Table 6.4. From this table, the relationship between SIZELOG appears to be stronger with COSTLOG than with FIRMCOST. Figure 6.8 shows several scatter plots illustrating the relationship between COSTLOG and the explanatory variables. The relationship between COSTLOG and SIZELOG appears to be linear. It is easier to interpret these scatter plots than those in Figure 6.6 due to the absence of the large unusual values of the dependent variable.

This line of thought is based on the work in the previous subsection and the plots of residuals from the preliminary regression fit. As a first step, we fit a model with all explanatory variables. Thus, this model is the same as the preliminary regression fit except using COSTLOG in lieu of FIRMCOST as the dependent variable. This model serves as a useful benchmark for our subsequent work. Table 6.6 summarizes the fit.

Figure 6.9 shows that the distribution of standardized residuals is less skewed than the corresponding in Figure 6.5. The distribution of leverages shows that there are still highly influential observations. (As a matter of fact, the distribution of leverages appear to be the same as in Figure 6.5. Why?) Four of the six variables have \\(t\\)-ratios less than one in absolute value, suggesting that we continue our search for a better model. Figure 6.9: Histograms of standardized residuals and leverages using COSTLOG as the dependent variable. To continue the search, a stepwise regression was run (although the output is not reproduced here). The output from this search technique, as well as the fitted regression model above, suggests using the variables SIZELOG and INDCOST to explain the dependent variable COSTLOG. We can run regression using SIZELOG and INDCOST as explanatory variables. From Figure 6.10, we see that the size and shape of the distribution of standardized residuals are similar to that in Figure 6.9. The leverages are much smaller, reflecting the elimination of several explanatory variables from the model. Remember that the average leverage is \\(\\bar{h} =(k+1)/n=3/73\\approx 0.04\\). Thus, we still have three points that exceed three times the average and thus are considered high leverage points.

The scatter plot of residuals versus INDCOST, in Figure 6.11, displays a mild quadratic trend in INDCOST. To see if this trend was important, the variable INDCOST was squared and used as an explanatory variable in a regression model. The results of this fit are in Table 6.6. From the \\(t\\)-ratio associated with (INDCOST)\\(^{2}\\), we see that the variable seems to be important. The sign is reasonable, indicating that the rate of increase of COSTLOG decreases as INDCOST increases. That is, the expected change in COSTLOG per unit change of INDCOST is positive and decreases as INDCOST increases. Further diagnostic checks of the model revealed no additional patterns. Thus, from the data available, we can not affirm any of the four hypotheses that were introduced in the Introduction subsection. This is not to say that these variables are not important. We are simply stating that the natural variability of the data was large enough to obscure any relationships that might exist. We have established, however, the importance of the size of the firm and the firm’s industry risk. Figure 6.12 graphically summarizes the estimated relationships among these variables. In particular, in lower right hand panel, we see that for most of the firms in the sample, FIRMCOST was relatively stable. However, for small firms, as measured by SIZELOG, the industry risk, as measured by INDCOST, was particularly important. For small firms, we see that the fitted FIRMCOST increases as the variable INDCOST increases, with the rate of increase leveling off. Although the model theoretically predicts FIRMCOST to decrease with a large INDCOST \\((&gt;1.2)\\), no small firms were actually in this area of the data region.

To learn more about linear regression, in Section 1.7 we gave references to alternative statistics books that introduce the topic. You may also be interested in a more technical presentation, such as the classic work by Seber (1977) or a more recent work by Abraham and Ledolter (2006). For other approaches, texts such as Wooldridge (2009) provide an econometrics perspective where the emphasis is on introducing regression in the context of economic theory. Alternatively, books such as Agresti and Finlay (2008) give an introduction from a broader social science perspective. There are many explanations of regression for readers with different perspectives and levels of quantitative training; this provides further evidence that this is an important topic for actuaries and other financial risk managers to understand. The other way of getting further insights into linear regression is to see it applied in a time series context in Part II of this book or in extensions to nonlinear modeling in Part III.

Fienberg (1985) gathered data from a report issued by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights about the number of homeowners and residential fire insurance policies issued in Chicago over the months of December 1977 through February 1978. Policies issued were categorized as either part of the standard voluntary market or the substandard, involuntary market. The involuntary market consists of “fair access to insurance requirements” (FAIR) plans; these are state insurance programs sometimes subsidized by private companies. These plans provide insurance to people who would otherwise be denied insurance on their property due to high-risk problems. The main purpose is to understand the relationship between insurance activity and the variable “race,” the percentage minority. Data are available for \\(n=47\\) zip codes in the Chicago area. These data have also been analyzed by Faraway (2005). To help control for the size of the expected loss, Fienberg also gathered theft and fire data from Chicago’s police and fire departments. Another variable that gives some information about loss size is the age of the house. The median income, from the Census Bureau, gives indirect information on the size of the expected loss as well as whether the applicant can afford insurance. Table 6.8 provides more details on these variables. Table 6.8: Insurance Availability in Chicago Variable Description Mean row.names Zip (postal) code race Racial composition in percent minority 35 fire Fires per 1,000 housing units 12.3 theft Thefts per 1,000 population 32.4 age Percent of housing units built in or before 1939 60.3 volact New homeowner policies plus renewals, minus cancelations and non-renewals per 100 housing units 6.53 involact New FAIR plan policies and renewals per 100 housing units 0.615 income Median family income 10696 Produce summary statistics of all variables, noting patterns of skewness for each variable. Create a scatter plot matrix of volact, involact and race. Comment on the three pairwise relationships. Are the patterns consistent with a hypothesis of racial discrimination? To understand relationships among the variables, produce a table of correlations. Fit a linear model using volact as the dependent variable and race, fire theft, age and income as explanatory variables. d(i). Comment on the sign and statistical significance of the coefficient associated with race. d(ii). Two zip codes turn out to have high leverage. Repeat your analysis after deleting these two observations. Has the significance of the race variable changed? What about the other explanatory variables? Repeat the analysis in part (d) using involact as the dependent variable. Define proportion to be involact/(volact+involact). Repeat the analysis in part (d) using proportion as the dependent variable. The same two zip codes have high leverage in parts (d), (e) and (f). Why is this so? This analysis is done at the zip code level, not the individual level. As emphasized by Harrington and Niehaus (1998), this introduces substantial potential omitted variable bias. What variables have been omitted from the analysis that you think might affect homeowners insurance availability and race? Fienberg notes that proximity of one zip code to another may affect the dependence of observations. Describe how you might incorporate spatial relations into a regression analysis. 6.2 Gender Equity in Faculty Pay. The University of Wisconsin at Madison completed a study entitled “Gender Equity Study of Faculty Pay,” dated June 5, 1992. The main purpose of the study was to determine whether women are treated unfairly in salary determinations at a major research university in the U.S. To this end, the committee that issued the report studied 1990 salaries of 1,898 faculty members in the university. It is well-known that men are paid more than women. In fact, the mean 1990 salary for the 1,528 male faculty members is 54,478, which is 28% higher than the mean 1990 salary for female faculty members, which is 43,315. However, it is argued that male faculty members are in general more senior (average years of experience is 18.8 years) than female faculty members (average years of experience is 11.9 years), and thus deserved higher pay. When comparing salaries of full professors (thus controlling for years of experience), male faculty members earned about 13% more than their female counterparts. Even so, it is generally agreed that fields in demand must offer higher salaries in order to maintain a world-class faculty. For example, salaries in engineering are higher than salaries in humanities simply because faculty in engineering have many more employment opportunities outside of academia than faculty in humanities. Thus, when considering salaries, one must also control for department. To control for these variables, a faculty study reports a regression analysis using the logarithm of salary as the dependent variable. The explanatory variables included information on race, gender, rank (either assistant professor/instructor, associate professor or full professor), several measures of years of experience, 98 different categories of departments and a measure of salary differential by department. There were 109 explanatory variables in all (including 97 departmental binary variables), of which 12 were non-departmental variables. Table 6.9 reports variable definitions, parameter estimates and \\(t\\)-ratios for the 12 non-departmental variables. The ANOVA Table 6.10 summarizes the regression fit.

Partition the matrix of explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) into two submatrices, each having \\(n\\) rows, so that \\(\\mathbf{X}=(\\mathbf{X}_{1} : \\mathbf{X}_{2})\\). For convenience, assume that \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\) is an \\(n \\times p\\) matrix. Similarly, partition the vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta =\\left( \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}^{\\prime }, \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}^{\\prime }\\right) ^{\\prime }\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{X \\boldsymbol \\beta }=\\mathbf{X}_{1} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+ \\mathbf{X}_{2} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\). We compare the full, or “long,” model \\[ \\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X \\boldsymbol \\beta }+\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\mathbf{X}_{1} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{X}_{2} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}+\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon \\] to the reduced, or “short,” model \\[ \\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}_{1} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\boldsymbol \\varepsilon. \\] This simply generalizes the set-up earlier to allow for omitting several variables. Effect of Underfitting. Suppose that the true representation is the long model but we mistakenly run the short model. Our parameter estimates when running the short model are given by \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}=\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y}\\). These estimates are biased because \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Bias} &amp;= \\text{E }\\mathbf{b}_{1}-\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} = \\text{E}\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y} -\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\text{E }\\mathbf{y}-\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\left( \\mathbf{X}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\right) - \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2} = \\mathbf{A \\boldsymbol \\beta }_{2}. \\end{array} \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\) is called the alias, or bias, matrix. When running the short model, the estimated variance is \\(s_{1}^{2}=(\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{b}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y})/(n-p)\\). It can be shown that \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{E }s_{1}^{2}=\\sigma ^{2}+(n-p)^{-1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}^{\\prime }\\left( \\mathbf{X}_{2}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{2}-\\mathbf{X}_{2}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\right) \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}. \\tag{6.3} \\end{equation}\\] Thus, \\(s_{1}^{2}\\) is an “overbiased” estimate of \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). Let \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime }\\) be the \\(i\\)th rows of \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\), respectively. Using the fitted short model, the \\(i\\)th fitted value is \\(\\hat{y}_{1i}=\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\). The true \\(i\\)th expected response is E \\(\\hat{y}_{1i}=\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime } \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} + \\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime } \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\). Thus, the bias of the \\(i\\)th fitted value is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\text{Bias}(\\hat{y}_{1i}) &amp;= \\text{E }\\hat{y}_{1i}-\\text{E }y_{i}=\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\text{E }\\mathbf{b}_{1}-\\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime } \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\right) \\\\ &amp; =\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{A \\boldsymbol \\beta }_{2})-\\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\right) =(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{A}-\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime })\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}. \\end{array} \\] Using this and equation (6.3), straightforward algebra shows that \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{E }s_{1}^{2}=\\sigma ^{2}+(n-p)^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\\text{Bias}(\\hat{y}_{1i}))^{2}. \\tag{6.4} \\end{equation}\\] Effect of Overfitting. Now suppose that the true representation is the short model but we mistakenly use the large model. With the alias matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}=\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\), we can reparameterize the long model \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{y} &amp; =\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{X}_{2}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2} + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon = \\mathbf{X}_{1}\\left( \\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{A \\boldsymbol \\beta }_{2}\\right) + \\mathbf{E}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2} + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon \\\\ &amp;= \\mathbf{X}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\alpha_{1}+\\mathbf{E}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2} + \\boldsymbol \\varepsilon \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1}=\\mathbf{X}_{2}-\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\alpha_{1}=\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\mathbf{A \\boldsymbol \\beta}_{2}\\). The advantage of this new parameterization is that \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\) is orthogonal to \\(\\mathbf{E}_{1}\\) because \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1}=\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }(\\mathbf{X}_{2}-\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{A})=\\mathbf{0}\\). With \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast }=(\\mathbf{X}_{1}: \\mathbf{E}_{1})\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\alpha =(\\boldsymbol \\alpha_{1}^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}^{\\prime })^{\\prime }\\), the vector of least squares estimates is \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathbf{a} &amp;= \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\\\ \\mathbf{b}_{1} \\end{bmatrix} = \\left( \\mathbf{X}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast }\\right) ^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{\\ast \\prime }\\mathbf{y} \\\\ &amp; = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathbf{(E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y} \\end{bmatrix} \\\\ &amp; = \\begin{bmatrix} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y} \\\\ \\mathbf{(E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y} \\end{bmatrix}. \\end{array} \\] From the true (short) model, \\(\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y}=\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\), we have that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{b}_{2} =(\\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1})^{-1}\\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathrm{E}(\\mathbf{y}) =(\\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1})^{-1}\\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathrm{E}~ (\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{\\beta}_{1}) =\\mathbf{0}, \\] because \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{E}_{1}=\\mathbf{0}\\). The least squares estimate of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\) is \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}=\\mathbf{a}_{1}-\\mathbf{Ab}_{2}\\). Because \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{a}_{1}=\\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathrm{E}~\\mathbf{y}=\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1} \\] under the short model, we have E \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}=\\) E \\(\\mathbf{a}_{1}-\\mathbf{A}\\)E \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2}=\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}-\\mathbf{0}=\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\). Thus, even though we mistakenly run the long model, \\(\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\) is still an unbiased estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mathbf{0}\\). Thus, there is no bias in the \\(i\\)th fitted value because \\[ \\mathrm{E}~\\hat{y}_{i}= \\mathrm{E}~(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}_{1}+\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}_{2})=\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}= \\mathrm{E}~y_{i} . \\] \\(C_{p}\\) Statistic. Suppose initially that the true representation is the long model but we mistakenly use the short model. The \\(i\\)th fitted value is \\(\\hat{y}_{1i}=\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\) that has mean square error \\[ \\text{MSE }\\hat{y}_{1i} = \\text{E}(\\hat{y}_{1i} - \\text{E }\\hat{y}_{1i})^{2} = \\text{Var }\\hat{y}_{1i} + \\left( \\text{Bias }\\hat{y}_{1i} \\right)^{2}. \\] For the first part, we have that \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\mathrm{Var}~\\hat{y}_{1i}&amp; =\\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}_{1}\\right) = \\text{Var} \\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime } \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{y}\\right) \\\\ &amp; = \\sigma^{2} \\mathbf{x}_{1i} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }. \\end{array} \\] We can think of \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1i} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime }\\) as the \\(i\\)th leverage, as in equation (5.3). Thus, \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathbf{x}_{1i} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime } = p\\), the number of columns of \\(\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\). With this, we can define the standardized total error \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\text{MSE }\\hat{y}_{1i}}{\\sigma^{2}} &amp; = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\text{Var }\\hat{y}_{1i} + \\left( \\text{Bias }\\hat{y}_{1i} \\right)^{2} \\right)}{\\sigma^{2}} \\\\ &amp; = \\frac{\\sigma^{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i} \\mathbf{(X}_{1}^{\\prime }\\mathbf{X}_{1}\\mathbf{)}^{-1} \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime } + \\left( \\text{Bias }\\hat{y}_{1i} \\right)^{2} \\right)}{\\sigma^{2}} \\\\ &amp;= p + \\sigma^{-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\text{Bias }\\hat{y}_{1i} \\right)^{2}. \\end{array} \\] Now, if \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) is known, from equation (6.4), an unbiased estimate of the standardized total error is \\(p + \\frac{(n-p)(s_{1}^{2} - \\sigma^{2})}{\\sigma^{2}}.\\) Because \\(\\sigma^{2}\\) is unknown, it must be estimated. If we are not sure whether the long or short model is the appropriate representation, a conservative choice is to use \\(s^{2}\\) from the long, or full, model. Even if the short model is the true model, \\(s^{2}\\) from the long model is still an unbiased estimate of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\). Thus, we define \\[ C_{p} = p + \\frac{(n-p)(s_{1}^{2} - s^{2})}{s^{2}}. \\] If the short model is correct, then \\(\\mathrm{E}~s_{1}^{2}=\\) \\(\\mathrm{E}~s^{2}=\\sigma^{2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{E}~C_{p} \\approx p\\).

A model with a categorical dependent variable allows one to predict whether an observation is a member of a distinct group, or category. Binary variables represent an important special case; they can indicate whether or not an event of interest has occurred. In actuarial and financial applications, the event may be whether a claim occurs, a person purchases insurance, a person retires or a firm becomes insolvent. The chapter introduces logistic regression and probit models of binary dependent variables. Categorical variables may also represent more than two groups, known as multicategory outcomes. Multicategory variables may be unordered or ordered, depending on whether it makes sense to rank the variable outcomes. For unordered outcomes, known as nominal variables, the chapter introduces generalized logits and multinomial logit models. For ordered outcomes, known as ordinal variables, the chapter introduces cumulative logit and probit models. 11.1 Binary Dependent Variables We have already introduced binary variables as a special type of discrete variable that can be used to indicate whether or not a subject has a characteristic of interest, such as sex for a person or ownership of a captive insurance company for a firm. Binary variables also describe whether or not an event of interest has occurred, such as an accident. A model with a binary dependent variable allows one to predict whether an event has occurred or a subject has a characteristic of interest. Example: MEPS Expenditures. Section 11.4 will describe an extensive database from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) on hospitalization utilization and expenditures. For these data, we will consider \\[ y_i = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{i-th person was hospitalized during the sample period} \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. . \\] There are \\(n=2,000\\) persons in this sample, distributed as: Table 11.1: Hospitalization by Sex Male Female Not hospitalized \\(y=0\\) 902 (95.3%) 941 (89.3%) Hospitalized \\(y=1\\) 44 (4.7%) 113 (10.7%) Total 946 1,054 R Code to Produce Table 11.1 Hexpend &lt;- read.csv(&quot;CSVData/HealthExpend.csv&quot;, header=TRUE) # Table 11.1 POSEXP = 1*(Hexpend$EXPENDIP&gt;0) #table(POSEXP) #table(Hexpend$GENDER) #Hmisc::summarize(POSEXP, Hexpend$GENDER, mean) row1 &lt;- c(&quot;Not hospitalized&quot; , &quot;$y=0$&quot; , &quot;902 (95.3%)&quot; , &quot;941 (89.3%)&quot; ) row2 &lt;- c(&quot;Hospitalized&quot; , &quot;$y=1$ &quot;, &quot;44 (4.7%)&quot; , &quot;113 (10.7%)&quot; ) row3 &lt;- c(&quot;Total&quot; , &quot;&quot;, &quot;946&quot; , &quot;1,054&quot; ) tableout &lt;- rbind(row1, row2, row3) row.names(tableout) &lt;- NULL colnames(tableout) &lt;- c(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;, &quot;Female&quot;) TableGen1(TableData=tableout, TextTitle=&#39;Hospitalization by Sex&#39;, Align=&#39;lccc&#39;, ColumnSpec=1:3, ColWidth = &quot;3cm&quot;) %&gt;% kableExtra::column_spec(1, width = &quot;4cm&quot;) Table 11.1 suggests that sex has an important influence on whether someone becomes hospitalized. Like the linear regression techniques introduced in prior chapters, we are interested in using characteristics of a person, such as their age, sex, education, income and prior health status, to help explain the dependent variable \\(y\\). Unlike the prior chapters, now the dependent variable is discrete and not even approximately normally distributed. In limited circumstances, linear regression can be used with binary dependent variables — this application is known as a linear probability model. Linear probability models To introduce some of the complexities encountered with binary dependent variables, denote the probability that the response equals 1 by \\(\\pi_i= \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i=1)\\). A binary random variable has a Bernoulli distribution. Thus, we may interpret the mean response as the probability that the response equals one, that is, \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i=0\\times \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i=0) + 1 \\times \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i=1) = \\pi_i\\). Further, the variance is related to the mean through the expression \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y_i = \\pi_i(1-\\pi_i)\\). We begin by considering a linear model of the form \\[ y_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\varepsilon_i, \\] known as a linear probability model. Assuming \\(\\mathrm{E~}\\varepsilon_i=0\\), we have that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }} \\boldsymbol \\beta =\\pi_i\\). Because \\(y_i\\) has a Bernoulli distribution, \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta(1-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\). Linear probability models are used because of the ease of parameter interpretations. For large data sets, the computational simplicity of ordinary least squares estimators is attractive when compared to some complex alternative nonlinear models introduced later in this chapter. As described in Chapter 3, ordinary least squares estimators for \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) have desirable properties. It is straightforward to check that the estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions on the explanatory variables {\\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\)}. However, linear probability models have several drawbacks that are serious for many applications. Drawbacks of the Linear Probability Model Fitted values can be poor. The expected response is a probability and thus must vary between 0 and 1. However, the linear combination, \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\), can vary between negative and positive infinity. This mismatch implies, for example, that fitted values may be unreasonable. Heteroscedasticity. Linear models assume homoscedasticity (constant variance), yet the variance of the response depends on the mean that varies over observations. The problem of varying variability is known as heteroscedasticity. Residual analysis is meaningless. The response must be either a 0 or 1 although the regression models typically regard the distribution of the error term as continuous. This mismatch implies, for example, that the usual residual analysis in regression modeling is meaningless. To handle the heteroscedasticity problem, a (two-stage) weighted least squares procedure is possible. In the first stage, one uses ordinary least squares to compute estimates of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). With this estimate, an estimated variance for each subject can be computed using the relation \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y_i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta (1-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\). At the second stage, a weighted least squares is performed using the inverse of the estimated variances as weights to arrive at new estimates of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). It is possible to iterate this procedure, although studies have shown that there are few advantages in doing so (see Carroll and Ruppert, 1988). Alternatively, one can use ordinary least squares estimators of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) with standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity (see Section 5.7.2). 11.2 Logistic and Probit Regression Models 11.2.1 Using Nonlinear Functions of Explanatory Variables To circumvent the drawbacks of linear probability models, we consider alternative models in which we express the expectation of the response as a function of explanatory variables, \\(\\pi_i=\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\) \\(=\\Pr (y_i=1|\\mathbf{x}_i)\\). We focus on two special cases of the function \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\cdot)\\): \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }(z)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp (-z)}=\\frac{e^{z}}{1+e^{z}}\\), the logit case, and \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }(z)=\\mathrm{\\Phi }(z)\\), the probit case. Here, \\(\\mathrm{\\Phi }(\\cdot)\\) is the standard normal distribution function. The choice of the identity function (a special kind of linear function), \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }(z)=z\\), yields the linear probability model. In contrast, \\(\\mathrm{\\pi}\\) is nonlinear for both the logit and probit cases. These two functions are similar in that they are almost linearly related over the interval \\(0.1 \\le p \\le 0.9\\). Thus, to a large extent, the function choice is dependent on the preferences of the analyst. Figure 11.1 compares the logit and probit functions showing that it will be difficult to distinguish between the two specifications with most data sets. The inverse of the function, \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }^{-1}\\), specifies the form of the probability that is linear in the explanatory variables, that is, \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }^{-1}(\\pi_i)= \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). In Chapter 13, we refer to this inverse as the link function. Figure 11.1: Comparison of Logit and Probit (Standard Normal) Distribution Example: Credit Scoring. Banks, credit bureaus, and other financial institutions develop “credit scores” for individuals that are used to predict the likelihood that the borrower will repay current and future debts. Individuals who do not meet stipulated repayment schedules in a loan agreement are said to be in “default.” A credit score is then a predicted probability of being in default, with the credit application providing the explanatory variables used in developing the credit score. The choice of explanatory variables depends on the purpose of the application; credit scoring is used for issuing credit cards for making small consumer purchases as well as mortgage applications for multimillion dollar houses. In Table 11.2, Hand and Henley (1997) provide a list of typical characteristics that are used in credit scoring. Table 11.2. Characteristics Used in Some Credit Scoring Procedures \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\hline \\textbf{Characteristics} &amp; \\textbf{Potential Values} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Time at present address} &amp; \\text{0-1, 1-2, 3-4, 5+ years}\\\\ \\text{Home status} &amp; \\text{Owner, tenant, other }\\\\ \\text{Postal Code} &amp; \\text{Band A, B, C, D, E} \\\\ \\text{Telephone} &amp; \\text{Yes, no} \\\\ \\text{Applicant&#39;s annual income} &amp; \\text{£ (0-10000),} \\text{£ (10,000-20,000)} \\text{£ (20,000+)} \\\\ \\text{Credit card} &amp; \\text{Yes, no} \\\\ \\text{Type of bank account} &amp; \\text{Check and/or savings, none} \\\\ \\text{Age }&amp; \\text{18-25, 26-40, 41-55, 55+ years} \\\\ \\text{County Court judgements} &amp; \\text{Number} \\\\ \\text{Type of occupation} &amp; \\text{Coded} \\\\ \\text{Purpose of loan} &amp; \\text{Coded} \\\\ \\text{Marital status} &amp; \\text{Married, divorced, single, widow, other} \\\\ \\text{Time with bank} &amp; \\text{Years} \\\\ \\text{Time with employer} &amp; \\text{Years }\\\\ \\hline \\textit{Source}: \\text{Hand and Henley (1997)} \\\\ \\end{array} } \\] With credit application information and default experience, a logistic regression model can be used to fit the probability of default with credit scores resulting from fitted values. Wiginton (1980) provides an early application of logistic regression to consumer credit scoring. At that time, other statistical methods known as discriminant analysis were at the cutting edge of quantitative scoring methodologies. In their review article, Hand and Henley (1997) discuss other competitors to logistic regression including machine learning systems and neural networks. As noted by Hand and Henley, there is no uniformly “best” method. Regression techniques are important in their own right due to their widespread usage and because they can provide a platform for learning about newer methods. Credit scores provide estimates of the likelihood of defaulting on loans but issuers of credit are also interested in the amount and timing of debt repayment. For example, a “good” risk may repay a credit balance so promptly that little profit is earned by the lender. Further, a “poor” mortgage risk may default on a loan so late in the duration of the contract that a sufficient profit was earned by the lender. See Gourieroux and Jasiak (2007) for a broad discussion of how credit modeling can be used to assess the riskiness and profitability of loans. 11.2.2 Threshold Interpretation Both the logit and probit cases can be interpreted as follows. Suppose that there exists an underlying linear model, \\(y_i^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta + \\varepsilon_i^{\\ast}\\). Here, we do not observe the response \\(y_i^{\\ast}\\) yet interpret it to be the “propensity” to possess a characteristic. For example, we might think about the financial strength of an insurance company as a measure of its propensity to become insolvent (no longer capable of meeting its financial obligations). Under the threshold interpretation, we do not observe the propensity but we do observe when the propensity crosses a threshold. It is customary to assume that this threshold is 0, for simplicity. Thus, we observe \\[ y_i=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 0 &amp; y_i^{\\ast} \\le 0 \\\\ 1 &amp; y_i^{\\ast}&gt;0 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] To see how the logit case is derived from the threshold model, assume a logistic distribution function for the disturbances, so that \\[ \\mathrm{\\Pr }(\\varepsilon_i^{\\ast} \\le a)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp (-a)}. \\] Like the normal distribution, one can verify by calculating the density that the logistic distribution is symmetric about zero. Thus, \\(-\\varepsilon_i^{\\ast}\\) has the same distribution as \\(\\varepsilon_i^{\\ast}\\) and so \\[ \\pi_i=\\Pr (y_i=1|\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\mathrm{\\Pr }(y_i^{\\ast}&gt;0)=\\mathrm{ \\Pr }(\\varepsilon_i^{\\ast} \\le \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\mathbf{ \\beta })=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp (-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)} =\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta). \\] This establishes the threshold interpretation for the logit case. The development for the probit case is similar and is omitted. 11.2.3 Random Utility Interpretation Both the logit and probit cases are also justified by appealing to the following “random utility” interpretation of the model. In some economic applications, individuals select one of two choices. Here, preferences among choices are indexed by an unobserved utility function; individuals select the choice that provides the greater utility. For the \\(i\\)th subject, we use the notation \\(u_i\\) for this utility function. We model the utility (\\(U\\)) as a function of an underlying value (\\(V\\)) plus random noise (\\(\\varepsilon\\)), that is, \\(U_{ij}=u_i(V_{ij}+\\varepsilon_{ij})\\), where \\(j\\) may be 1 or 2, corresponding to the choice. To illustrate, we assume that the individual chooses the category corresponding to \\(j=1\\) if \\(U_{i1}&gt;U_{i2}\\) and denote this choice as \\(y_i=1\\). Assuming that \\(u_i\\) is a strictly increasing function, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\Pr (y_i &amp;=&amp;1)=\\mathrm{\\Pr }(U_{i2}&lt;U_{i1})=\\mathrm{\\Pr }\\left( u_i(V_{i2}+\\varepsilon_{i2})&lt;u_i(V_{i1}+\\varepsilon_{i1})\\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{\\Pr }(\\varepsilon_{i2}-\\varepsilon_{i1}&lt;V_{i1}-V_{i2}). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] To parameterize the problem, assume that the value \\(V\\) is an unknown linear combination of explanatory variables. Specifically, we take \\(V_{i2}=0\\) and \\(V_{i1}=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). We may take the difference in the errors, \\(\\varepsilon_{i2}-\\varepsilon_{i1}\\), as normal or logistic, corresponding to the probit and logit cases, respectively. The logistic distribution is satisfied if the errors are assumed to have an extreme-value, or Gumbel, distribution (see, for example, Amemiya, 1985). 11.2.4 Logistic Regression An advantage of the logit case is that it permits closed-form expressions, unlike the normal distribution function. Logistic regression is another phrase used to describe the logit case. Using \\(p=\\mathrm{\\pi }(z)= \\left( 1+ \\mathrm{e}^{-z}\\right)^{-1}\\), the inverse of \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }\\) is calculated as \\(z=\\mathrm{\\pi }^{-1}(p)=\\ln(p/(1-p))\\). To simplify future presentations, we define \\[ \\mathrm{logit}(p)=\\ln \\left( \\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) \\] to be the logit function. With a logistic regression model, we represent the linear combination of explanatory variables as the logit of the success probability, that is, \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta=\\mathrm{logit}(\\pi_i)\\). Odds interpretation When the response \\(y\\) is binary, knowing only \\(p=\\Pr(y=1)\\) summarizes the entire distribution. In some applications, a simple transformation of \\(p\\) has an important interpretation. The lead example of this is the odds, given by \\(p/(1-p)\\). For example, suppose that \\(y\\) indicates whether or not a horse wins a race and \\(p\\) is the probability of the horse winning. If \\(p=0.25\\), then the odds of the horse winning is $ 0.25/(1.00-0.25)=0.3333$. We might say that the odds of winning are 0.3333 to 1, or one to three. Equivalently, we say that the probability of not winning is \\(1-p=0.75\\) so that the odds of the horse not winning is $ 0.75/(1-0.75)=3$ and the odds against the horse are three to one. Odds have a useful interpretation from a betting standpoint. Suppose that we are playing a fair game and that we place a bet of 1 with one to three odds. If the horse wins, then we get our 1 back plus winnings of 3. If the horse loses, then we lose our bet of 1. It is a fair game in the sense that the expected value of the game is zero because we win 3 with probability \\(p=0.25\\) and lose 1 with probability \\(1-p=0.75\\). From an economic standpoint, the odds provide the important numbers (bet of 1 and winnings of 3), not the probabilities. Of course, if we know \\(p\\), then we can always calculate the odds. Similarly, if we know the odds, we can always calculate the probability \\(p\\). The logit is the logarithmic odds function, also known as the log odds. Odds ratio interpretation To interpret the regression coefficients in the logistic regression model, \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta=(\\beta_0,\\ldots ,\\beta_{k})^{\\prime}\\), we begin by assuming that \\(j\\)th explanatory variable, \\(x_{ij}\\), is either 0 or 1. Then, with the notation \\(\\mathbf{x}_i=(x_{i0},...,x_{ij},\\ldots ,x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\), we may interpret \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\beta_j &amp;=&amp;(x_{i0},...,1,\\ldots ,x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta -(x_{i0},...,0,\\ldots ,x_{ik})^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=1)}{1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=1)}\\right) -\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=0)}{1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=0)}\\right) \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Thus, \\[ e^{\\beta_j}=\\frac{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=1)/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=1)\\right) }{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=0)/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij}=0)\\right) }. \\] This shows that \\(e^{\\beta_j}\\) can be expressed as the ratio of two odds, known as the odds ratio. That is, the numerator of this expression is the odds when \\(x_{ij}=1,\\) whereas the denominator is the odds when \\(x_{ij}=0\\). Thus, we can say that the odds when \\(x_{ij}=1\\) are \\(\\exp (\\beta_j)\\) times as large as the odds when \\(x_{ij}=0\\). To illustrate, suppose \\(\\beta_j=0.693\\), so that \\(\\exp (\\beta _j)=2\\). From this, we say that the odds (for \\(y=1\\)) are twice as great for \\(x_{ij}=1\\) as for \\(x_{ij}=0\\). Similarly, assuming that \\(j\\)th explanatory variable is continuous (differentiable), we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\beta_j &amp;=&amp;\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{ij}}\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta =\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{ij}}\\ln \\left( \\frac{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})}{1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})}\\right) \\nonumber \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{ij}}\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})\\right) }{\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i=1|x_{ij})\\right) }. \\tag{11.1} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Thus, we may interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) as the proportional change in the odds ratio, known as an elasticity in economics. Example: MEPS Expenditures - Continued. Table 11.1 shows that the percentage of females who were hospitalized is \\(10.7\\%\\); alternatively, the odds of females being hospitalized is \\(0.107/(1-0.107)=0.120\\). For males, the percentage is \\(4.7\\%\\) so that the odds were \\(0.0493\\). The odds ratio is \\(0.120/0.0493=2.434\\); females are more than twice as likely to be hospitalized as males. From a logistic regression fit (described in Section 11.4), the coefficient associated with sex is \\(0.733\\). Based on this model, we say that females are \\(\\exp (0.733)=2.081\\) times as likely as males to be hospitalized. The regression estimate of the odds ratio controls for additional variables (such as age and education) compared to the basic calculation based on raw frequencies. 11.3 Inference for Logistic and Probit Regression Models 11.3.1 Parameter Estimation The customary method of estimation for logistic and probit models is maximum likelihood, described in further detail in Section 11.9. To provide intuition, we outline the ideas in the context of binary dependent variable regression models. The likelihood is the observed value of the probability function. For a single observation, the likelihood is \\[ \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1-\\pi_i &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\ y_i=0 \\\\ \\pi_i &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\ y_i=1 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] The objective of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the parameter values that produce the largest likelihood. Finding the maximum of the logarithmic function yields the same solution as finding the maximum of the corresponding function. Because it is generally computationally simpler, we consider the logarithmic (or log-) likelihood, written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\ln \\left( 1-\\pi_i\\right) &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\ y_i=0 \\\\ \\ln \\pi_i &amp; \\mathrm{if}\\ y_i=1 \\end{array} \\right. . \\tag{11.2} \\end{equation}\\] More compactly, the log-likelihood of a single observation is \\[ y_i\\ln \\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta) + (1-y_i) \\ln \\left( 1-\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta)\\right) , \\] where \\(\\pi_i=\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta )\\). Assuming independence among observations, the likelihood of the data set is a product of likelihoods of each observation. Taking logarithms, the log-likelihood of the data set is the sum of log-likelihoods of single observations. The log-likelihood of the data set is \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\boldsymbol \\beta)=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left\\{ y_i\\ln \\mathrm{\\pi }( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta) + (1-y_i) \\ln \\left( 1- \\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\right) \\right\\} . \\tag{11.3} \\end{equation}\\] The log-likelihood is viewed as a function of the parameters, with the data held fixed. In contrast, the joint probability mass function is viewed as a function of the realized data, with the parameters held fixed. The method of maximum likelihood involves finding the values of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) that maximize the log-likelihood. The customary method of finding the maximum is taking partial derivatives with respect to the parameters of interest and finding roots of the resulting equations. In this case, taking partial derivatives with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) yields the score equations \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta}L(\\boldsymbol \\beta )=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{x}_i\\left( y_i-\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{\\pi }^{\\prime}( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)}{\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)(1-\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{ \\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta))}=\\mathbf{0}, \\tag{11.4} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\pi^{\\prime}\\) is the derivative of \\(\\pi\\). The solution of these equations, denoted as \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\), is the maximum likelihood estimator. For the logit function the score equations reduce to \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta}L(\\boldsymbol \\beta )=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mathbf{x}_i\\left( y_i-\\mathrm{\\pi }(\\mathbf{x} _i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\right) =\\mathbf{0}, \\tag{11.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{\\pi }(z)=1/(1+\\exp (-z))\\). 11.3.2 Additional Inference An estimator of the large sample variance of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) may be calculated taking partial derivatives of the score equations. Specifically, the term \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = - \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2} {\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ~ \\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ^{\\prime}}L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) \\right) \\] is the information matrix. As a special case, using the logit function and equation (11.5), straightforward calculations show that the information matrix is \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\sigma_i^2 \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\] where \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{\\pi} (\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta) (1 - \\mathrm{\\pi}(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta))\\). The square root of the \\((j+1)st\\) diagonal element of this matrix evaluated at \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) yields the standard error for \\(b_{j,MLE}\\), denoted as \\(se(b_{j,MLE})\\). To assess the overall model fit, it is customary to cite likelihood ratio test statistics in nonlinear regression models. To test the overall model adequacy \\(H_0:\\boldsymbol \\beta=\\mathbf{0}\\), we use the statistic \\[ LRT=2\\times (L(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE})-L_0), \\] where \\(L_0\\) is the maximized log-likelihood with only an intercept term. Under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), this statistic has a chi-square distribution with \\(k\\) degrees of freedom. Section 11.9.3 describes likelihood ratio test statistics in greater technical detail. As described in Section 11.9, measures of goodness of fit can be difficult to interpret in nonlinear models. One measure is the so-called \\(max-scaled~R^2\\), defined as \\(R_{ms}^2=R^2/R_{max}^2\\), where \\[ R^2=1-\\left( \\frac{\\exp (L_0/n)}{\\exp (L(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE})/n)}\\right) \\] and \\(R_{max }^2 = 1 - \\exp(L_0/n)^2\\). Here, \\(L_0/n\\) represents the average value of this log-likelihood. Another measure is a “pseudo-\\(R^2\\)” \\[ \\frac{L( \\mathbf{b}_{MLE}) - L_0}{L_{max}-L_0}, \\] where \\(L_0\\) and \\(L_{max }\\) is the log-likelihood based on only an intercept and on the maximum achievable, respectively. Like the coefficient of determination, the pseudo-\\(R^2\\) takes on values between zero and one, with larger values indicating a better fit to the data. Other versions of pseudo-\\(R^2\\)’s are available in the literature, see, for example, Cameron and Trivedi (1998). An advantage of this pseudo-\\(R^2\\) measure is its link to hypothesis testing of regression coefficients. Example: Job Security. Valletta (1999) studied declining job security using the Panel Survey of Income Dynamics (PSID) database. We consider here one of the regression models presented by Valletta, based on a sample of male heads of households that consists of \\(n=24,168\\) observations over the years 1976-1992, inclusive. The PSID survey records reasons why men left their most recent employment, including plant closures, “quit”and changed jobs for other reasons. However, Valletta focused on dismissals (“laid off” or “fired”) because involuntary separations are associated with job insecurity. Table 11.3 presents a probit regression model run by Valletta (1999), using dismissals as the dependent variable. In addition to the explanatory variables listed in Table 11.3, other variables controlled for consisted of education, marital status, number of children, race, years of full-time work experience and its square, union membership, government employment, logarithmic wage, the U.S. employment rate and location as measured through the Metropolitan Statistical Area residence. In Table 11.3, tenure is years employed at the current firm. Further, sector employment was measured by examining the Consumer Price Survey employment in 387 sectors of the economy, based on 43 industry categories and nine regions of the country. On the one hand, the tenure coefficient reveals that more experienced workers are less likely to be dismissed. On the other hand, the coefficient associated with the interaction between tenure and time trend reveals an increasing dismissal rate for experienced workers. The interpretation of the sector employment coefficients is also of interest. With an average tenure of about 7.8 years in the sample, we see the low tenure men are relatively unaffected by changes in sector employment. However, for more experienced men, there is an increasing probability of dismissal associated with sectors of the economy where growth declines. Table 11.3.

MEPS is a probability survey that provides nationally representative estimates of health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian population. This survey collects detailed information on individuals and each medical care episode by type of services including physician office visits, hospital emergency room visits, hospital outpatient visits, hospital inpatient stays, all other medical provider visits, and use of prescribed medicines. This detailed information allows one to develop models of health care utilization to predict future expenditures. We consider MEPS data from the first panel of 2003 and take a random sample of \\(n=2,000\\) individuals between ages 18 and 65. Dependent Variable Our dependent variable is an indicator of positive expenditures for inpatient admissions. For MEPS, inpatient admissions include persons who were admitted to a hospital and stayed overnight. In contrast, outpatient events include hospital outpatient department visits, office-based provider visits and emergency room visits excluding dental services. (Dental services, compared to other types of health care services, are more predictable and occur on a more regular basis.) Hospital stays with the same date of admission and discharge, known as “zero-night stays,” were included in outpatient counts and expenditures. Payments associated with emergency room visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay were included in the inpatient expenditures. Prescribed medicines that can be linked to hospital admissions were included in inpatient expenditures (not in outpatient utilization). Explanatory Variables Explanatory variables that can help explain health care utilization are categorized as demographic, geographic, health status, education and economic factors. Demographic factors include age, sex and ethnicity. As persons age, the rate at which their health deteriorates increases with age; as a result, age has an increasing impact on the demand for health care. Sex and ethnicity can be treated as proxies for inherited health and social habits in maintaining health. For a geographic factor, we use region to proxy the accessibility of health care services and the overall economic or regional impact on residents’ health care behavior. The demand for medical services is thought to be influenced by individuals’ health status and education. In MEPS, self-rated physical health, mental health and any functional or activity related limitations during the sample period are used as proxies for health status. Education tends to have ambiguous impact on the demand for health care services. One theory is that more educated persons are more aware of health risks, thus being more active in maintaining their health; as a result, educated persons may be less prone to severe diseases leading to hospital admissions. Another theory is that less educated persons have greater exposure to health risks and, through exposure, develop a greater tolerance for certain types of risks. In MEPS, education is proxied by degrees received and categorized into three different levels: lower than high school, high school, and college or above education. Economic covariates include income and insurance coverage. A measure of income in MEPS is income relative to the poverty line. This approach is appropriate because it summarizes effects of different levels of income on health care utilization in constant dollars. Insurance coverage is also an important variable in explaining health care utilization. One issue with health insurance coverage is that it reduces the out-of-pocket prices paid by insureds and thus induces moral hazard. Research associated with the Rand Health Insurance Experiment empirically suggested that cost sharing effects from insurance coverage will affect primarily the number of medical contacts rather than the intensity of each contact. This motivated our introduction of a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if a person had any public or private health insurance for at least one month, and 0 otherwise. Summary Statistics Table 11.4 describes these explanatory variables and provides summary statistics that suggest their effects on the probability of positive inpatient expenditures. For example, we see that females had a higher overall utilization than males. Specifically, 10.7% of females had a positive expenditure during the year compared to only 4.7% for males. Similarly, utilizations vary by other covariates, suggesting their importance as predictors of expenditures. Table 11.4.

Fits are reported under the “Full Model” column for all variables using the logit function. The \\(t\\)-ratios for many of the explanatory variables exceed two in absolute value, suggesting that they are useful predictors. From an inspection of these \\(t\\)-ratios, one might consider a more parsimonious model by removing statistically insignificant variables. Table 11.5 shows a “Reduced Model,” where the age and mental health status variables have been removed. To assess their joint significance, we can compute a likelihood ratio test statistic as twice the change in the log-likelihood. This turns out to be only \\(2\\times \\left( -488.78-(-488.69)\\right) =0.36.\\) Comparing this to a chi-square distribution with \\(df=2\\) degrees of freedom results in a \\(p\\)-value\\(=0.835\\), indicating that the additional parameters for age and mental health status are not statistically significant. Table 11.5 also provides probit model fits. Here, we see that the results are similar to the logit model fits, according to sign of the coefficients and their significance, suggesting that for this application there is little difference in the two specifications. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly.

We assume that the dependent variable \\(y\\) may take on values \\(1, 2, \\ldots , c,\\) corresponding to \\(c\\) categories. When \\(c&gt;2\\), we refer to the data as “multicategory,” also known as polychotomous or polytomous. In many applications, the response categories correspond to an attribute possessed or choices made by individuals, households or firms. Some applications include: employment choice, such as Valletta (1999) mode of transportation, such as the classic work by McFadden (1978) type of health insurance, as in Browne and Frees (2007). For an observation from subject \\(i\\), denote the probability of choosing the \\(j\\)th category as \\(\\pi_{ij}= \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j)\\), so that \\(\\pi_{i1}+\\cdots+\\pi_{ic}=1\\). In general, we will model these probabilities as a (known) function of parameters and use maximum likelihood estimation for statistical inference. Let \\(y_{ij}\\) be a binary variable that is 1 if \\(y_i=j\\). Extending equation (11.2) to \\(c\\) categories, the likelihood for the \\(i\\)th subject is: \\[ \\prod_{j=1}^c \\left( \\pi_{i,j} \\right)^{y_{i,j}} =\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} \\pi_{i,1} &amp; \\mathrm {if}~ y_i = 1 \\\\ \\pi_{i,2} &amp; \\mathrm {if}~ y_i = 2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ \\pi_{i,c} &amp; \\mathrm {if}~ y_i = c \\\\ \\end{array} \\right. . \\] Thus, assuming independence among observations, the total log-likelihood is \\[ L = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^c y_{i,j}~ \\mathrm{ln}~ \\pi_{i,j} . \\] With this framework, standard maximum likelihood estimation is available (Section 11.9). Thus, our main task is to specify an appropriate form for \\(\\pi\\). 11.5.1 Generalized Logit Like standard linear regression, generalized logit models employ linear combinations of explanatory variables of the form: \\[\\begin{equation} V_{i,j} = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta_j . \\tag{11.6} \\end{equation}\\] Because the dependent variables are not numerical, we cannot model the response \\(y\\) as a linear combination of explanatory variables plus an error. Instead we use the probabilities \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = j \\right) = \\pi_{i,j} = \\frac {\\exp (V_{i,j})}{\\sum_{k=1}^c \\exp(V_{i,k})} . \\tag{11.7} \\end{equation}\\] Note here that \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_j\\) is the corresponding vector of parameters that may depend on the alternative \\(j\\) whereas the explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) do not. So that probabilities sum to one, a convenient normalization for this model is \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_c =\\mathbf{0}\\). With this normalization and the special case of \\(c = 2\\), the generalized logit reduces to the logit model introduced in Section 11.2. Parameter interpretations We now describe an interpretation of coefficients in generalized logit models, similar to the logistic model. From equations (11.6) and (11.7), we have \\[ \\mathrm{ln}~ \\frac{\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = j \\right)} {\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = c \\right)} = V_{i,j} - V_{i,c} =\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta_j . \\] The left-hand side of this equation is interpreted to be the logarithmic odds of choosing choice \\(j\\) compared to choice \\(c\\). Thus, we may interpret \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_j\\) as the proportional change in the odds ratio. Generalized logits have an interesting nested structure that we will explore briefly in Section 11.5.3. That is, it is easy to check that, conditional on not choosing the first category, the form of Pr(\\(y_i = j| y_i \\neq 1\\)) has a generalized logit form in equation (11.7). Further, if \\(j\\) and \\(h\\) are different alternatives, we note that \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j| y_i=j ~\\mathrm{or}~ y_i=h) &amp;=&amp;\\frac{\\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j)}{\\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j)+\\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = h)} =\\frac{\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,j})}{\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,j})+\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,h})} \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{1+\\mathrm{exp}(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol \\beta _h - \\boldsymbol \\beta_j))} . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This has a logit form that was introduced in Section 11.2. Special Case - Intercept only model. To develop intuition, we now consider the model with only intercepts. Thus, let \\(\\mathbf{x}_i = 1\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_j = \\beta_{0,j} = \\alpha_j\\). With the convention \\(\\alpha_c=0\\), we have \\[ \\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = j \\right) = \\pi_{i,j} = \\frac {e^{\\alpha_j}}{e^{\\alpha_1}+e^{\\alpha_2}+\\cdots+e^{\\alpha_{c-1}}+1} \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{ln}~ \\frac{\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = j \\right)} {\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = c \\right)} = \\alpha_j. \\] From the second relation, we may interpret the \\(j\\)th intercept \\(\\alpha_j\\) to be the logarithmic odds of choosing alternative \\(j\\) compared to alternative \\(c\\). Example: Job Security - Continued. This is a continuation of the Section 11.2 example on the determinants of job turnover, based on the work of Valletta (1999). The first analysis of this data considered only the binary dependent variable dismissal as this outcome is the main source of job insecurity. Valetta (1999) also presented results from a generalized logit model, his primary motivation being that the economic theory describing turnover implies that other reasons for leaving a job may affect dismissal probabilities. For the generalized logit model, the response variable has \\(c = 5\\) categories: dismissal, left job because of plant closures, “quit,” changed jobs for other reasons and no change in employment. The “no change in employment” category is the omitted one in Table 11.6. The explanatory variables of the generalized logit are the same as the probit regression; the estimates summarized in Table 11.1 are reproduced here for convenience. Table 11.6 shows that turnover declines as tenure increases. To illustrate, consider a typical man in the 1992 sample where we have time = 16 and focus on dismissal probabilities. For this value of time, the coefficient associated with tenure for dismissal is -0.221 + 16 (0.008) = -0.093 (due to the interaction term). From this, we interpret an additional year of tenure to imply that the dismissal probability is exp(-0.093) = 91% of what it would be otherwise, representing a decline of 9%. Table 11.6 also shows that the generalized coefficients associated with dismissal are similar to the probit fits. The standard errors are also qualitatively similar, although higher for the generalized logits when compared to the probit model. In particular, we again see that the coefficient associated with the interaction between tenure and time trend reveals an increasing dismissal rate for experienced workers. The same is true for the rate of quitting. Table 11.6.

Omitted category is no change in employment for the generalized logit. Other variables controlled for consist of education, marital status, number of children, race, years of full-time work experience and its square, union membership, government employment, logarithmic wage, the U.S. employment rate and location. 11.5.2 Multinomial Logit Similar to equation (11.6), an alternative linear combination of explanatory variables is \\[\\begin{equation} V_{i,j} = \\mathbf{x}_{i,j}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\tag{11.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,j}\\) is a vector of explanatory variables that depends on the \\(j\\)th alternative whereas the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) do not. Using the expressions in equations (11.7) and (11.8) forms the basis of the multinomial logit model, also known as the conditional logit model (McFadden, 1974). With this specification, the total log-likelihood is \\[ L = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^c y_{i,j}~ \\mathrm{ln}~ \\pi_{i,j} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\sum_{j=1}^c y_{i,j} \\mathbf{x}_{i,j}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\ - \\mathrm{ln} \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^c \\mathrm{exp}(\\mathbf{x}_{i,k}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta) \\right) \\right]. \\] This straightforward expression for the likelihood enables maximum likelihood inference to be easily performed. The generalized logit model is a special case of the multinomial logit model. To see this, consider explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_j\\), each of dimension \\(k\\times 1\\). Define \\[ \\mathbf{x}_{i,j} = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{x}_i \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\end{array}\\right) ~~~ \\mathrm{and}~~~ \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\left( \\begin{array}{c} \\boldsymbol \\beta_1 \\\\ \\boldsymbol \\beta_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\boldsymbol \\beta_c \\\\ \\end{array} \\right). \\] Specifically, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,j}\\) is defined as \\(j-1\\) zero vectors (each of dimension \\(k\\times 1\\)), followed by \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and then followed by \\(c-j\\) zero vectors. With this specification, we have \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,j}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta =\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta_j\\). Thus, a statistical package that performs multinomial logit estimation can also perform generalized logit estimation through the appropriate coding of explanatory variables and parameters. Another consequence of this connection is that some authors use the descriptor multinomial logit when referring to the generalized logit model. Moreover, through similar coding schemes, multinomial logit models can also handle linear combinations of the form: \\[ V_i = \\mathbf{x}_{i,1,j}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta + \\mathbf{x}_{i,2}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta_j . \\] Here, \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,1,j}\\) are explanatory variables that depend on the alternative whereas \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i,2}\\) do not. Similarly, \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_j\\) are parameters that depend on the alternative whereas \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) do not. This type of linear combination is the basis of a mixed logit model. As with conditional logits, it is customary to choose one set of parameters as the baseline and specify \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_c = \\mathbf{0}\\) to avoid redundancies. To interpret parameters for the multinomial logit model, we may compare alternatives \\(h\\) and \\(k\\) using equations (11.7) and (11.8), to get \\[ \\mathrm{ln}~ \\frac{\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = h \\right)} {\\mathrm{Pr} \\left(y_i = k \\right)} = (\\mathbf{x}_{i,h}-\\mathbf{x}_{i,k}) ^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta . \\] Thus, we may interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) as the proportional change in the odds ratio, where the change is the value of the \\(j\\)th explanatory variable, moving from the \\(k\\)th to the \\(h\\)th alternative. With equation (11.7), note that \\(\\pi_{i,1} / \\pi_{i,2} = \\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,1}) /\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,2})\\). This ratio does not depend on the underlying values of the other alternatives, \\(V_{i,j}\\), for \\(j=3, \\ldots, c\\). This feature, called the independence of irrelevant alternatives, can be a drawback of the multinomial logit model for some applications. Example: Choice of Health Insurance. To illustrate, Browne and Frees (2007) examined \\(c=4\\) health insurance choices, consisting of: \\(y=1\\) - an individual covered by group insurance, \\(y=2\\) - an individual covered by private, non-group insurance, \\(y=3\\) - an individual covered by government, but not private insurance or \\(y=4\\) - an individual not covered by health insurance. Their data on health insurance coverage came from the March supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS), conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Browne and Frees (2007) analyzed approximately 10,800 single person households per year, covering 1988-1995, yielding \\(n=86,475\\) observations. They examined whether underwriting restrictions, laws passed to prohibit insurers from discrimination, facilitate or discourage consumption of health insurance. They focused on disability laws that prohibited insurers from using physical impairment (disability) as an underwriting criterion. Table 11.7 suggests that disability laws have little effect on the average health insurance purchasing behavior. To illustrate, for individuals surveyed with disability laws in effect, 57.6% purchased group health compared to 59.3% of those where restrictions were not in effect. Similarly, 19.9% were uninsured when disability restrictions were in effect compared to 20.1% when they were not. In terms of odds, when disability restrictions were in effect, the odds of purchasing group health insurance compared to becoming uninsured are 57.6/19.9 = 2.895. When disability restrictions were not in effect, the odds are 2.946. The odds ratio, 2.895/2.946 = 0.983, indicates that there is little change in the odds when comparing whether or not disability restrictions were in effect. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly.

Table 11.8 shows the percent uninsured and odds of purchasing group insurance (compared to being uninsured) for selected subgroups. To illustrate, for disabled individuals, the odds of purchasing group insurance are 1.329 times higher when disability restrictions are in effect. Table 11.7 suggests that disability restrictions have no effect; this may be true when looking at the entire sample. However, by examining subgroups, Table 11.8 shows that we may see important effects associated with legal underwriting restrictions that are not evident when looking at averages over the whole sample. Table 11.8: Odds of Health Coverage by Law and Physical Impairment Selected Subgroups Disability Law in Effect Number Percentage Group Percentage Uninsured Odds-Comparing Group to Uninsured Odds Ratio Nondisabled No 72150 64.2 20.5 3.134 Nondisabled Yes 3649 63.4 21.2 2.985 0.952 Disabled No 10096 24.5 17.6 1.391 Disabled Yes 580 21 11.4 1.848 1.329 There are many ways of picking subgroups of interest. With a large dataset of \\(n=86,475\\) observations, one could probably pick subgroups to confirm almost any hypothesis. Further, there is a concern that the CPS data may not provide a representative sample of state populations. Thus, it is customary to use regression techniques to “control” for explanatory variables, such as physical impairment. Table 11.9 reports the main results from a multinomial logit model with many control variables included. A dummy variable for each of 50 states was included (the District of Columbia is a “state” in this data set, so we need \\(51-1=50\\) dummy variables). These variables were suggested in the literature and are further described in Browne and Frees (2007). They include an individual’s gender, marital status, race, education, whether or not self-employed and whether an individual worked full-time, part-time or not at all. In Table 11.9, “Law” refers to the binary variable that is 1 if a legal restriction was in effect and “Disabled” is a binary variable that is 1 if an individual is physically impaired. Thus, the interaction “Law*Disabled” reports the effect of a legal restriction on a physically impaired individual. The interpretation is similar to Table 11.8. Specifically, we interpret the coefficient 1.419 to mean that disabled individuals are 41.9% more likely to purchase group health insurance compared to purchasing no insurance, when the disability underwriting restriction is in effect. Similarly, non-disabled individuals are 21.2% (\\(=1/0.825 - 1\\)) less likely to purchase group health insurance compared to purchasing no insurance, when the disability underwriting restriction is in effect. This result suggests that the non-disabled are more likely to be uninsured as a result of prohibitions on the use of disability status as an underwriting criteria. Overall, the results are statistically significant, confirming that this legal restriction does have an impact on the consumption of health insurance. Table 11.9: Odds Ratios from Multinomial Logit Regression Model Group versus Uninsured Nongroup versus Uninsured Government versus Uninsured Group versus Nongroup Group versus Government Nongroup versus Governement Law \\(\\times\\) Nondisabled 0.825 1.053 1.010 0.784 0.818 1.043 \\(p\\)-Value 0.001 0.452 0.900 0.001 0.023 0.677 Law \\(\\times\\) Disabled 1.419 0.953 1.664 1.490 0.854 0.573 \\(p\\)-Value 0.062 0.789 0.001 0.079 0.441 0.001 Notes: The regression includes 150 (\\(=50 \\times 3\\)) state-specific effects, several continuous variables (age, education and income, as well as higher order terms) and categorical variables (such as race and year). 11.5.3 Nested Logit To mitigate the problem of independence of irrelevant alternatives in multinomial logits, we now introduce a type of hierarchical model known as a nested logit model. To interpret the nested logit model, in the first stage one chooses an alternative (say the first alternative) with probability \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi_{i,1} = \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = 1) = \\frac{\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,1})}{\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,1})+ \\left[ \\sum_{k=2}^c \\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,k}/ \\rho) \\right]^{\\rho}} . \\tag{11.9} \\end{equation}\\] Then, conditional on not choosing the first alternative, the probability of choosing any one of the other alternatives follows a multinomial logit model with probabilities \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\pi_{i,j}}{1-\\pi_{i,1}} = \\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j | y_i \\neq 1) = \\frac{\\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,j}/ \\rho)}{\\sum_{k=2}^c \\mathrm{exp}(V_{i,k}/ \\rho) }, ~~~j=2, \\ldots, c . \\tag{11.10} \\end{equation}\\] In equations (11.9) and (11.10), the parameter \\(\\rho\\) measures the association among the choices \\(j = 2, \\ldots, c\\). The value of \\(\\rho=1\\) reduces to the multinomial logit model that we interpret to mean independence of irrelevant alternatives. We also interpret Prob(\\(y_i = 1\\)) to be a weighted average of values from the first choice and the others. Conditional on not choosing the first category, the form of \\(\\mathrm{Pr}(y_i = j| y_i \\neq 1)\\) in equation (11.10) has the same form as the multinomial logit. The advantage of the nested logit is that it generalizes the multinomial logit model in a way such that we no longer have the problem of independence of irrelevant alternatives. A disadvantage, pointed out by McFadden (1981), is that only one choice is observed; thus, we do not know which category belongs in the first stage of the nesting without additional theory regarding choice behavior. Nonetheless, the nested logit generalizes the multinomial logit by allowing alternative “dependence” structures. That is, one may view the nested logit as a robust alternative to the multinomial logit and examine each one of the categories in the first stage of the nesting. 11.6 Ordinal Dependent Variables We now consider a response that is an ordered categorical variable, also known as an ordinal dependent variable. To illustrate, any type of survey response where you score your impression on a seven point scale ranging from “very dissatisfied” to “very satisfied” is an example of an ordinal variable. Example: Health Plan Choice. Pauly and Herring (2007) examined \\(c=4\\) choices of health care plan types, consisting of: \\(y=1\\) - a health maintenance organization (HMO), \\(y=2\\) - a point of service (POS) plan, \\(y=3\\) - a preferred provider organization (PPO) or \\(y=4\\) - a fee for service (FFS) plan. A FFS plan is the least restrictive, allowing enrollees to see health care providers (such as primary care physicians) for a fee reflecting the cost of services rendered. The PPO plan is the next least restrictive; this plan generally uses FFS payments but enrollees generally must choose from a list of “preferred providers.” Pauly and Herring (2007) took POS and HMO plans to be the third and fourth least restrictive, respectively. An HMO often uses capitation (a flat rate per person) to reimburse providers, restricting enrollees to a network of providers. In contrast, a POS plan gives enrollees the option to see providers outside of the HMO network (for an additional fee). 11.6.1 Cumulative Logit Models of ordinal dependent variables are based on cumulative probabilities of the form \\[ \\mathrm{Pr} ( y \\le j ) = \\pi_1 + \\cdots + \\pi_j, ~ ~ j=1, \\ldots, c . \\] In this section, we use cumulative logits \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{logit}\\left(\\mathrm{Pr} ( y \\le j ) \\right) = \\mathrm{ln} \\left(\\frac{\\Pr ( y \\le j )}{1-\\Pr ( y \\le j )} \\right) = \\mathrm{ln} \\left(\\frac{\\pi_1 + \\cdots + \\pi_j}{\\pi_{j+1} + \\cdots + \\pi_c} \\right) . \\tag{11.11} \\end{equation}\\] The simplest cumulative logit model is \\[ \\mathrm{logit}\\left(\\Pr ( y \\le j ) \\right) = \\alpha_j \\] that does not use any explanatory variables. The “cut-point” parameters \\(\\alpha_j\\) are nondecreasing so that \\(\\alpha_1 \\le \\alpha_2 \\le \\ldots \\le \\alpha_c,\\) reflecting the cumulative nature of the distribution function \\(\\mathrm{Pr} ( y \\le j )\\). The proportional odds model incorporates explanatory variables. With this model, cumulative logits are expressed as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{logit}\\left(\\Pr ( y \\le j ) \\right) = \\alpha_j + \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta . \\tag{11.12} \\end{equation}\\] This model provides parameter interpretations similar to those for logistic regression described in Section 11.4. For example, if the variable \\(x_1\\) is continuous, then as in equation (11.1) we have \\[ \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{i1}}\\left( \\alpha_j + \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{\\partial }{\\partial x_{i1}}\\Pr (y_i \\le j|\\mathbf{x}_i)/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i \\le j|\\mathbf{x}_i)\\right) }{\\Pr (y_i \\le j|\\mathbf{x}_i)/\\left( 1-\\Pr (y_i \\le j|\\mathbf{x}_i)\\right) }. \\] Thus, we may interpret \\(\\beta_1\\) as the proportional change in the cumulative odds ratio. Example: Health Plan Choice - Continued. Pauly and Herring used data from the 1996-1997 and 1998-1999 Community Tracking Study’s Household Surveys (CTS-HS) to study the demand for health insurance. This is a nationally representative survey containing over 60,000 individuals per period. As one measure of demand, Pauly and Herring examined health plan choice, reasoning that individuals that chose (through employment or association membership) less restrictive plans sought greater protection for health care. (They also looked at other measures, including the number of restrictions placed on plans and the amount of cost-sharing.) Table 11.10 provides determinants of health plan choice based on \\(n=34,486\\) individuals who had group health insurance, aged 18-64 without public insurance. Pauly and Herring also compared these results to those who had individual health insurance to understand the differences in determinants between these two markets. Table 11.10. Cumulative Logit Model of Health Plan Choice \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{llll} \\hline \\textbf{Variable} &amp; \\textbf{Odds Ratio} &amp; \\textbf{Variable} &amp; \\textbf{Odds Ratio} \\\\ \\hline \\text{Age} &amp; 0.992^{***} &amp; \\text{Hispanic} &amp; 1.735^{***} \\\\ \\text{Female} &amp; 1.064^{***} &amp; \\text{Risk taker} &amp; 0.967 \\\\ \\text{Family size} &amp; 0.985 &amp; \\text{Smoker} &amp; 1.055^{***} \\\\ \\text{Family income} &amp; 0.963^{***} &amp; \\text{Fair/poor health} &amp; 1.056 \\\\ \\text{Education} &amp; 1.006 &amp; \\alpha_1 &amp; 0.769^{***} \\\\ \\text{Asian} &amp; 1.180^{***} &amp; \\alpha_2 &amp; 1.406^{***} \\\\ \\text{African-American} &amp; 1.643^{***} &amp; \\alpha_3 &amp; 12.089^{***} \\\\ \\text{Maximum-rescaled } R^2 &amp; 0.102 &amp; \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Notes: Source: Pauly and Herring (2007). \\(^{***}\\) indicates that the associated \\(p\\)-values are less than 0.01. For race, Caucasian is the omitted variable. To interpret the odds ratios in Table 11.10, we first note that the cut-point estimates, corresponding to \\(\\alpha_1,\\) \\(\\alpha_2\\) and \\(\\alpha_3\\), increase as choices become less restrictive, as anticipated. For gender, we see that the estimated odds for females are 1.064 times that of males in the direction of choosing a less restrictive health plan. Controlling for other variables, females are more likely to choose less restrictive plans than males. Similarly, younger, less wealthy, non-Caucasian and smokers are more likely to choose less restrictive plans. Coefficients associated with family size, education, risk taking and self reported health were not statistically significant in this fitted model. 11.6.2 Cumulative Probit As in Section 11.2.2 for logistic regression, cumulative logit models have a threshold interpretation. Specifically, let \\(y_i^{\\ast}\\) be a latent, unobserved, random variable upon which we base the observed dependent variable as \\[ y_i=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; y_i^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha_1 \\\\ 2 &amp; \\alpha_1 &lt; y_i^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha_2 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ c-1 &amp; \\alpha_{c-2} &lt; y_i^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha_{c-1} \\\\ c &amp; \\alpha_{c-1} &lt; y_i^{\\ast}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right. . \\] If \\(y_i^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) has a logistic distribution, then \\[ \\Pr(y_i^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\le a)=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp (-a)} \\] and thus \\[ \\Pr(y_i \\le j ) = \\Pr(y_i^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha_j) =\\frac{1}{1+\\exp \\left( -(\\alpha_j - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta) \\right)}. \\] Applying the logit transform to both sides yields equation (11.12). Alternatively, assume that \\(y_i^{\\ast} - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) has a standard normal distribution. Then, \\[ \\Pr(y_i \\le j ) = \\Pr(y_i^{\\ast} \\le \\alpha_j) =\\Phi \\left( \\alpha_j - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right). \\] This is the cumulative probit model. As with binary variable models, the cumulative probit gives results that are similar to the cumulative logit model. 11.7 Further Reading and References Regression models of binary variables are used extensively.

Suppose that the random variable \\(y^{\\ast}\\) has a logit distribution function, \\(\\Pr(y^{\\ast} \\le y) = \\mathrm{F}(y) = e^y/(1+e^y).\\) Calculate the corresponding probability density function. Use the probability density function to compute the mean (\\(\\mu_y)\\). Compute the corresponding standard deviation (\\(\\sigma_y\\)). Define the rescaled random variable \\(y^{\\ast \\ast} =\\frac{y^{\\ast}-\\mu_y}{\\sigma_y}.\\) Determine the probability density function for \\(y^{\\ast \\ast}\\). Plot the probability density function in part (d). Overlay this plot with a plot of a standard normal probability density function. (This provides a density function version of the distribution function plots in Figure 11.1.) 11.2 Threshold interpretation of the probit regression model. Consider an underlying linear model, \\(y_i^{\\ast }=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{ \\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta+\\epsilon_i^{\\ast }\\), where \\(\\epsilon_i^{\\ast }\\) is normally distributed with mean zero and variance \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\). Define \\(y_i=\\mathrm{I}(y_i^{\\ast }&gt;0),\\) where I(\\(\\cdot\\)) is the indicator function. Show that \\(\\pi_i=\\Pr (y_i=1|\\mathbf{x}_i)\\) \\(=\\mathrm{\\Phi }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\mathbf{\\beta /\\sigma })\\), where \\(\\mathrm{\\Phi }(\\cdot)\\) is the standard normal distribution function. 11.3 Random utility interpretation of the logistic regression model. Under the random utility interpretation, an individual with utility $ U_{ij}=u_i(V_{ij}+_{ij})$, where \\(j\\) may be 1 or 2, selects category corresponding to \\(j=1\\) with probability \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\pi_i &amp;=&amp; \\Pr (y_i =1)=\\mathrm{\\Pr }(U_{i2}&lt;U_{i1}) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{\\Pr }(\\epsilon _{i2}-\\epsilon _{i1}&lt;V_{i1}-V_{i2}). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] As in Section 11.2.3, we take \\(V_{i2}=0\\) and \\(V_{i1}=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). Further suppose that the errors are from an extreme value distribution of the form \\[ \\Pr (\\epsilon_{ij}&lt;a)=\\exp (-e^{-a}). \\] Show that the choice probability \\(\\pi_i\\) has a logit form. That is, show \\[ \\pi_i=\\frac{1}{1+\\exp (-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta)}. \\] 11.4 Two Populations. Begin with one population and assume that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) is an i.i.d. sample from a Bernoulli distribution with mean \\(\\pi\\). Show that the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\pi\\) is \\(\\overline{y}\\). Now consider two populations. Suppose that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_{n_1}\\) is an i.i.d. sample from a Bernoulli distribution with mean \\(\\pi_1\\) and \\(y_{n_1+1}, \\ldots, y_{n_1+n_2}\\) is an i.i.d. sample from a Bernoulli distribution with mean \\(\\pi_2\\), where the samples are independent of one another. b(i). Show that the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\pi_2 - \\pi_1\\) is \\(\\overline{y}_2 - \\overline{y}_1\\). b(ii). Determine the variance of the estimator in part b(i). Now express the two population problem in a regression context using one explanatory variable. Specifically, suppose that \\(x_i\\) only takes on the values 0 and 1. Out of the \\(n\\) observations, \\(n_1\\) take on the value \\(x=0\\). These \\(n_1\\) observations have an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_1\\). The remaining \\(n_2 =n-n_1\\) observations have value \\(x=1\\) and an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_2\\). Using the logit case, let \\(b_{0,MLE}\\) and \\(b_{1,MLE}\\) represent the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), respectively. c(i). Show that the maximum likelihood estimators satisfy the equations \\[ \\overline{y}_1 = \\mathrm{\\pi}\\left(b_{0,MLE}\\right) \\] and \\[ \\overline{y}_2 = \\mathrm{\\pi}\\left(b_{0,MLE}+b_{1,MLE}\\right). \\] c(ii). Use part c(i) to show that the maximum likelihood estimator for \\(\\beta_1\\) is \\(\\mathrm{\\pi}^{-1}(\\overline{y}_2)-\\mathrm{\\pi}^{-1}(\\overline{y}_1)\\). c(iii). With the notation \\(\\pi_1 = \\mathrm{\\pi}(\\beta_0)\\) and \\(\\pi_2 = \\mathrm{\\pi}(\\beta_0 +\\beta_1)\\), confirm that the information matrix can be expressed as \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = n_1 \\pi_1 (1-\\pi_1) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right) + n_2 \\pi_2 (1-\\pi_2) \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ 1 &amp; 1 \\\\ \\end{array} \\right). \\] c(iv). Use the information matrix to determine the large sample variance of the maximum likelihood estimator for \\(\\beta_1\\). 11.5 Fitted Values. Let \\(\\widehat{y}_i = \\mathrm{\\pi }\\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b}_{MLE})\\right)\\) denote the \\(i\\)th fitted value for the logit function. Assume that an intercept is used in the model so that one of the explanatory variables \\(x\\) is a constant equal to one. Show that the average response is equal to the average fitted value, that is, show \\(\\overline{y} = n^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\widehat{y}_i\\). 11.6 Beginning with the score equations (11.4), verify the expression for the logit case in equation (11.5). 11.7 Information Matrix Beginning with the score function for the logit case in equation (11.5), show that the information matrix can be expressed as \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} \\sigma_i^2 \\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}, \\] where \\(\\sigma_i^2 = \\mathrm{\\pi}(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta)(1-\\mathrm{\\pi}(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta))\\). Beginning with the general score function in equation (11.4), determine the information matrix. 11.8 Automobile injury insurance claims. Refer to the description in Exercise 1.5. We consider \\(n=1,340\\) bodily injury liability claims from a single state using a 2002 survey conducted by the Insurance Research Council (IRC). The IRC is a division of the American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters and the Insurance Institute of America. The survey asked participating companies to report claims closed with payment during a designated two week period. In this assignment, we are interested in understanding the characteristics of the claimants who choose to be presented by an attorney when settling their claim. Variable descriptions are given Table 11.11. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly. Create a table just to update the counter...&quot;) Table 11.10: Silly. Create a table just to update the counter… x 2 Table 11.11: Bodily Injury Claims Variable \\(\\textbf{Description}\\) ATTORNEY whether the claimant is represented by an attorney (=1 if yes and =2 if no) CLMAGE claimant’s age CLMSEX claimant’s gender (=1 if male and =2 if female) MARITAL claimant’s marital status), (=1 if married, =2 if single, =3 if widowed, and =4 if divorced/separated) SEATBELT whether or not the claimant was wearing a seatbelt/child restraint (=1 if yes, =2 if no, and =3 if not applicable) CLMINSUR whether or not the driver of the claimant’s vehicle was uninsured (=1 if yes, =2 if no, and =3 if not applicable) LOSS the claimant’s total economic loss (in thousands). Summary Statistics. Calculate histograms and summary statistics of continuous explanatory variables CLMAGE and LOSS. Based on these results, create a logarithm version of LOSS, say lnLOSS. Examine the means of CLMAGE, LOSS and lnLOSS by level of ATTORNEY. Do these statistics suggest that the continuous variables differ by ATTORNEY? Create tables of counts (or percentages) of ATTORNEY by level of CLMSEX, MARITAL, SEATBELT, and CLMINSUR. Do these statistics suggest that the categorial variables differ by ATTORNEY? Identify the number of missing values for each explanatory variable. Logistic Regression Models. Run a logistic regression model using only the explanatory variable CLMSEX. Is it an important factor in determining the use of an attorney? Provide an interpretation in terms of the odds of using an attorney. Run a logistic regression model using the explanatory variables CLMAGE, CLMSEX, MARITAL, SEATBELT, and CLMINSUR. Which variables appear to be statistically significant? For the model in part (ii), who uses attorneys more, men or women? Provide an interpretation in terms of the odds of using an attorney for the variable CLMSEX. Run a logistic regression model using the explanatory variables CLMAGE, CLMSEX, MARITAL, SEATBELT, CLMINSUR, LOSS and lnLOSS. Decide which of the two loss measures is more important and re-run the model using only one of these variables. In this model, is the measure of losses a statistically significant variable? Run your model in part (iv) but omitting the variable CLMAGE. Describe differences between this model fit and that in part (iv), focusing on statistically significant variables and number of observations used in the model fit. Consider a single male claimant who is age 32. Assume that the claimant was wearing a seat belt, that the driver was insured and the total economic loss is $5,000. For the model in part (iv), what is the estimate of the probability of using an attorney? Probit Regression. Repeat part b(v) using probit regression models but interpret only the sign of the regression coefficients. 11.9 Hong Kong Horse Racing. The race track is a fascinating example of financial market dynamics at work. Let’s go to the track and make a wager. Suppose that, from a field of 10 horses, we simply want to pick a winner. In the context of regression, we will let \\(y\\) be the response variable indicating whether a horse wins (\\(y\\) = 1) or not (\\(y\\) = 0). From racing forms, newspapers and so on, there are many explanatory variables that are publicly available that might help us predict the outcome for \\(y\\). Some candidate variables may include the age of the horse, recent track performance of the horse and jockey, pedigree of the horse, and so on. These variables are assessed by the investors present at the race, the betting crowd. Like many financial markets, it turns out that one of the most useful explanatory variable is the crowd’s overall assessment of the horse’s abilities. These assessments are not made based on a survey of the crowd, but rather based on the wagers placed. Information about the crowd’s wagers is available on a large sign at the race called the tote board. The tote board provides the odds of each horse winning a race. Table 11.12 is a hypothetical tote board for a race of 10 horses. Table 11.12. Hypothetical Tote Board \\[ \\scriptsize{ \\begin{array}{l|cccccccccc} \\hline \\text{Horse} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 10 \\\\ \\text{Posted Odds} &amp; 1-1 &amp; 79-1 &amp; 7-1 &amp; 3-1 &amp; 15-1 &amp; 7-1 &amp; 49-1 &amp; 49-1 &amp; 19-1 &amp; 79-1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] The odds that appear on the tote board have been adjusted to provide a “track take.” That is, for every dollar that has been wagered, $\\(T\\) goes to the track for sponsoring the race and $(1-\\(T\\)) goes to the winning bettors. Typical track takes are in the neighborhood of twenty percent, or \\(T\\)=0.20. We can readily convert the odds on the tote board to the crowd’s assessment of the probabilities of winning. To illustrate this, Table 11.13 shows hypothetical bets to win which resulted in the displayed information on the hypothetical tote board in Table 11.12. Table 11.13. Hypothetical Bets \\[ \\scriptsize{ \\begin{array}{l|cccccccccc} \\hline \\text{Horse} &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 10 &amp; Total\\\\ \\hline \\text{Bets} to Win &amp; 8,000 &amp; 200 &amp; 2,000 &amp; 4,000 &amp; 1,000 &amp; 3,000 &amp; 400 &amp; 400 &amp; 800 &amp; 200 &amp; 20,000 \\\\ \\text{Probability} &amp; 0.40 &amp; 0.01 &amp; 0.10 &amp; 0.20 &amp; 0.05 &amp; 0.15 &amp; 0.02 &amp; 0.02 &amp; 0.04 &amp; 0.02 &amp; 1.000 \\\\ \\text{Posted Odds} &amp; 1-1 &amp; 79-1 &amp; 7-1 &amp; 3-1 &amp; 15-1 &amp; 7-1 &amp; 49-1 &amp; 49-1 &amp; 19-1 &amp; 79-1 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] For this hypothetical race, 20,000 was bet to win. Because 8,000 of this 20,000 was bet on the first horse, interpret the ratio 8000/20000 = 0.40 as the crowd’s assessment of the probability to win. The theoretical odds are calculated as 0.4/(1-0.4) = 2/3, or a 0.67 bet wins 1. However, the theoretical odds assume a fair game with no track take. To adjust for the fact that only (1-\\(T\\)) are available to the winner, the posted odds for this horse would be 0.4/(1-\\(T\\)-0.4) = 1, if \\(T\\)=0.20. For this case, it now takes a 1 bet to win 1. We then have the relationship \\(adjusted~odds = x/(1-T-x)\\), where \\(x\\) is the crowd’s assessment of the probability of winning. Before the start of the race, the tote board provides us with adjusted odds that can readily be converted into \\(x\\), the crowd’s assessment of winning. We use this measure to help us to predict \\(y\\), the event of the horse actually winning the race. We consider data from 925 races run in Hong Kong from September, 1981 through September, 1989. In each race, there were ten horses, one of whom was randomly selected to be in the sample. In the data, use FINISH = \\(y\\) to be the indicator of a horse winning a race and WIN = \\(x\\) to be the crowd’s a priori probability assessment of a horse winning a race. A statistically naive colleague would like to double the sample size by picking two horses from each race instead of randomly selecting one horse from a field of 10. Describe the relationship between the dependent variables of the two horses selected. Say how this violates the regression model assumptions. Calculate the average FINISH and summary statistics for WIN. Note that the standard deviation of FINISH is higher than that of WIN, even though the sample means are about the same. For the variable FINISH, what is the relationship between the sample mean and standard deviation? Calculate summary statistics of WIN by level of FINISH. Note that the sample mean is larger for horses that won (FINISH = 1) than for those that lost (FINISH = 0). Interpret this result. Estimate a linear probability model, using WIN to predict FINISH. Is WIN a statistically significant predictor of FINISH? How well does this model fit the data using the usual goodness of fit statistic? For this estimated model, is it possible for the fitted values to lie outside the interval [0, 1]? Note, by definition, that the x-variable WIN must lie within the interval [0, 1]. Estimate a logistic regression model, using WIN to predict FINISH. Is WIN a statistically significant predictor of FINISH? Compare the fitted values from the models in parts (d) and (e) For each model, provide fitted values at WIN = 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10 and 1.0. Plot fitted values from the linear probability model versus fitted values from the logistic regression model. Interpret WIN as the crowd’s prior probability assessment of the probability of a horse winning a race. The fitted values, FINISH, is your new estimate of the probability of a horse winning a race, based on the crowd’s assessment. Plot the difference FINISH - WIN versus WIN. Discuss a betting strategy that you might employ based on the difference, FINISH - WIN. 11.10 Demand for Term Life Insurance. We continue our study of Term Life Insurance Demand from Chapters 3 and 4. Specifically, we examine the 2004 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), a nationally representative sample that contains extensive information on assets, liabilities, income, and demographic characteristics of those sampled (potential U.S. customers). We now return to the original sample of \\(n=500\\) families with positive incomes and study whether or not a family purchases term life insurance. From our sample, it turns out that 225 did not (FACEPOS=0), whereas 275 did purchase term life insurance (FACEPOS=1). Summary Statistics. Provide a table of means of explanatory variables by level of the dependent variable FACEPOS. Interpret what we learn from this table. Linear Probability Model.

Who is more likely to purchase term life insurance, married or “non” married? Provide an interpretation in terms of the odds of purchasing term life insurance for the variable MARSTAT1. d(iii). Consider a married male who is age 54. Assume that this person has 13 years of education, annual wages of $70,000 and is living in a household composed of four people. For this model, what is the estimate of the probability of purchasing term life insurance? 11.11 Success in Actuarial Studies. Much like the medical and legal fields, members of the actuarial profession face interesting problems and are generally well compensated for their efforts in resolving these problems. Also like the medical and legal professions, the educational barriers to becoming an actuary are challenging, limiting entrance into the field. To advise students on whether they have the potential to meet the demands of this intellectually challenging field, Smith and Schumacher (2006) studied attributes of students in a business college. Specifically, they examined \\(n=185\\) freshman at Bryant University in Rhode Island who had begun their college careers in 1995-2001. The dependent variable of interest was whether they graduated with an actuarial concentration, for these students the first step to becoming a professional actuary. Of these, 77 graduated with an actuarial concentration and the other 108 dropped the concentration (at Bryant, most transferred to other concentrations although some left the university). Smith and Schumacher (2006) reported the effects of four early assessment mechanisms as well as GENDER, a control variable. The assessment mechanisms were: PLACE%, performance on a mathematics placement exam administered just prior to the freshman year, MSAT and VSAT, mathematics (M) and verbal (V) portions of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and RANK, high school rank given as a proportion (with closer to one being better). Table 11.14 shows that students who eventually graduated with an actuarial concentration performed higher on these early assessment mechanisms than actuarial dropouts. A logistic regression was fit to the data with the results reported in Table 11.14. To get a sense of which variables are statistically significance, calculate \\(t\\)-ratios for each variable. For each variable, state whether or not it is statistically significant. To get a sense of the relative impact of the assessment mechanisms, use the coefficients in Table 11.14 to compute estimated success probabilities for the following combination of variables. In your calculations, assume that GENDER=1. b(i). Assume PLACE% =0.80, MSAT = 680, VSAT=570 and RANK=0.90. b(ii). Assume PLACE% =0.60, MSAT = 680, VSAT=570 and RANK=0.90. b(iii).

Consider the following “case-control” sample selection method for binary dependent variables. Intuitively, if we are working with a problem where the event of interest is rare, we want to make sure that we sample a sufficient number of events so that our estimation procedures are reliable. Suppose that we have a large database consisting of \\(\\{y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i\\}\\), \\(i=1,\\ldots, N\\) observations. (For insurance company records, \\(N\\) could easily be ten million or more.) We want to make sure to get plenty of \\(y_i = 1\\) (corresponding to claims or “cases”) in our sample, plus a sample of \\(y_i = 0\\) (corresponding to non-claims or “controls”). Thus, we split the data set into two subsets. For the first subset consisting of observations with \\(y_i = 1\\), we take a random sample with probability \\(\\tau_1\\). Similarly, for the second subset consisting of observations with \\(y_i = 0\\), we take a random sample with probability \\(\\tau_0\\). For example, in practice we might use \\(\\tau_1=1\\) and \\(\\tau_0 = 0.10\\), corresponding to taking all of the claims and a 10% sample of non-claims - thus, \\(\\tau_1\\) and \\(\\tau_1\\) are considered known to the analyst. Let \\(\\{r_i = 1\\}\\) denote the event that the observation is selected to be part of the analysis. Determine \\(\\Pr(y_i = 1, r_i = 1)\\), \\(\\Pr(y_i = 0, r_i = 1)\\) and \\(\\Pr(r_i = 1)\\) in terms of \\(\\tau_0\\), \\(\\tau_1\\) and \\(\\pi_i = \\Pr(y_i=1)\\). Using the calculations in part (a), determine the conditional probability \\(\\Pr(y_i=1 | r_i=1)\\). Now assume that \\(\\pi_i\\) has a logistic form (\\(\\pi(z) = \\exp(z)/(1+\\exp(z))\\) and \\(\\pi_i= \\pi(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta ))\\). Re-write your answer part (b) using this logistic form. Write the likelihood of the observed \\(y_i\\)’s (conditional on \\(r_i = 1, i=1, \\ldots, n\\)). Show how we can interpret this as the usual logistic regression likelihood with the exception that the intercept has changed. Specify the new intercept in terms of the original intercept, \\(\\tau_0\\) and \\(\\tau_1\\). 11.9 Technical Supplements - Likelihood-Based Inference Begin with random variables \\(\\left( y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\right) ^{\\prime} = \\mathbf y\\) whose joint distribution is known up to a vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). In regression applications, \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) consists of the regression coefficients, \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\), and possibly a scale parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\) as well as additional parameters. This joint probability density function is denoted as \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). The function may also be a probability mass function for discrete random variables or a mixture distribution for random variables that have discrete and continuous components. In each case, we can use the same notation, \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta),\\) and call it the likelihood function. The likelihood is a function of the parameters with the data (\\(\\mathbf{y}\\)) fixed rather than a function of the data with the parameters (\\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\)) fixed. It is customary to work with the logarithmic version of the likelihood function and thus we define the log-likelihood function to be \\[ L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = L(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) = \\ln \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta), \\] evaluated at a realization of \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). In part, this is because we often work with the important special case where the random variables \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are independent. In this case, the joint density function can be expressed as a product of the marginal density functions and, by taking logarithms, we can work with sums. Even when not dealing with independent random variables, as with time series data, it is often computationally more convenient to work with log-likelihoods than the original likelihood function. 11.9.1 Properties of Likelihood Functions Two basic properties of likelihood functions are: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right) = \\mathbf 0 \\tag{11.13} \\end{equation}\\] and \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right) + \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} \\right) = \\mathbf 0. \\tag{11.14} \\end{equation}\\] The derivative of the log-likelihood function, \\(\\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)/\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\), is called the score function. Equation (11.13) shows that the score function has mean zero. To see this, under suitable regularity conditions, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta )}{\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta )} \\right) = \\int \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\int \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta ) d \\mathbf y \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} 1 = \\mathbf 0. \\end{eqnarray*}\\] For convenience, this demonstration assumes a density for f(\\(\\cdot\\)); extensions to mass and mixtures distributions are straightforward. The proof of equation (11.14) is similar and is omitted. To establish equation (11.13), we implicitly used “suitable regularity conditions” to allow the interchange of the derivative and integral sign. To be more precise, an analyst working with a specific type of distribution can use this information to check that the interchange of the derivative and integral sign is valid. Using equation (11.14), we can define the information matrix \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\frac{ \\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} \\right) = -\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right). \\tag{11.15} \\end{equation}\\] This quantity is used extensively in the study of large sample properties of likelihood functions. The information matrix appears in the large sample distribution of the score function. Specifically, under broad conditions, we have that \\(\\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)/\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\) has a large sample normal distribution with mean 0 and variance \\(\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). To illustrate, suppose that the random variables are independent so that the score function can be written as \\[ \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) =\\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\ln \\prod_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{f}(y_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ). \\] The score function is the sum of mean zero random variables because of equation (11.13); central limit theorems are widely available to ensure that sums of independent random variables have large sample normal distributions (see Section 1.4 for an example). Further, if the random variables are identical, then from equation (11.15) we can see that the second moment of \\(\\partial \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i;\\boldsymbol \\theta ) /\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is the information matrix, yielding the result. 11.9.2 Maximum Likelihood Estimators Maximum likelihood estimators are values of the parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) that are “most likely” to have been produced by the data. The value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), say \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\), that maximizes \\(\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{y};\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) is called the* maximum likelihood estimator*. Because \\(\\ln(\\cdot)\\) is a one-to-one function, we can also determine \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\) by maximizing the log-likelihood function, \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\). Under broad conditions, we have that \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\) has a large sample normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) and variance \\(\\left( \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right)^{-1}\\). This is a critical result upon which much of estimation and hypothesis testing is based. To underscore this result, we examine the special case of “normal-based” regression. Special Case. Regression with normal distributions. Suppose that \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are independent and normally distributed, with mean \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mu_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). The parameters can be summarized as \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta = \\left( \\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\prime}, \\sigma^2 \\right)^{\\prime}.\\) Recall from equation (1.1) that the normal probability density function is \\[ \\mathrm{f}(y; \\mu_i, \\sigma^2)=\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 }\\left( y-\\mu_i \\right)^2\\right) . \\] With this, the two components of the score function are \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\sigma^2) =-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} \\left(y_i-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right)^2 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; -\\frac{(-2)}{2 \\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) \\mathbf{x}_i \\end{eqnarray*}\\] and \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\sigma^2} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{ \\partial}{\\partial \\sigma^2} \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\sigma^2) = -\\frac{n}{2 \\sigma^2} + \\frac {1}{2 \\sigma ^4}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i-\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right)^2 . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Setting these equations to zero and solving yields the maximum likelihood estimators \\[ \\boldsymbol \\beta_{MLE} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\right)^{-1} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_i y_i = \\mathbf{b} \\] and \\[ \\sigma^2_{MLE} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{b} \\right)^2 = \\frac{n-(k+1)}{n} s^2. \\] Thus, the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is equal to the usual least squares estimator. The maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is a scalar multiple of the usual least squares estimator. The least squares estimators \\(s^2\\) is unbiased whereas as \\(\\sigma^2_{MLE}\\) is only approximately unbiased in large samples. The information matrix is \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = -\\mathrm{E~} \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ~\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\prime}} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) &amp; \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ~\\partial \\sigma^2} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\\\ \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\sigma^2 \\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\prime} } L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) &amp; \\frac{ \\partial^2}{\\partial \\sigma^2 \\partial \\sigma^2} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\\\ \\end{array} \\right)= \\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\frac{ 1}{\\sigma^2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\frac{n}{2 \\sigma^4}\\\\ \\end{array} \\right). \\] Thus, \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{MLE} = \\mathbf{b}\\) has a large sample normal distribution with mean \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) and variance-covariance matrix \\(\\sigma^2 \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\right)^{-1}\\), as seen previously. Moreover, \\(\\sigma^2_{MLE}\\) has a large sample normal distribution with mean \\(\\sigma^2\\) and variance \\(2 \\sigma^4 /n.\\) Maximum likelihood is a general estimation technique that can be applied in many statistical settings, not just regression and time series applications. It can be applied broadly and enjoys certain optimality properties. We have already cited the result that maximum likelihood estimators typically have a large sample normal distribution. Moreover, maximum likelihood estimators are the most efficient in the following sense. Suppose that \\(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\) is an alternative unbiased estimator. The Cramer-Rao theorem states, under mild regularity conditions, for all vectors \\(\\mathbf c\\), that \\(\\mathrm{Var~} \\mathbf c^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE} \\le \\mathrm{Var~} \\mathbf c^{\\prime} \\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\), for sufficiently large \\(n\\). We also note that \\(2 \\left( L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}) - L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right)\\) has a chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the dimension of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) . In a few applications, such as the regression case with a normal distribution, maximum likelihood estimators can be computed analytically as a closed-form expression. Typically, this can be done by finding roots of the first derivative of the function. However, in general, maximum likelihood estimators can not be calculated with closed form expressions and are determined iteratively. Two general procedures are widely used: 1. Newton-Raphson uses the iterative algorithm \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol \\theta_{NEW} = \\boldsymbol \\theta_{OLD} - \\left. \\left\\{ \\left( \\frac{ \\partial^2 L}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta \\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta^{\\prime}} \\right)^{-1} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta } \\right\\} \\right|_ {\\boldsymbol \\theta = \\boldsymbol \\theta_{OLD}} . \\tag{11.16} \\end{equation}\\] 2. Fisher scoring uses the iterative algorithm \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol \\theta_{NEW} = \\boldsymbol \\theta_{OLD} + \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{OLD})^{-1} \\left. \\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta } \\right\\} \\right|_ {\\boldsymbol \\theta = \\boldsymbol \\theta_{OLD}} . \\tag{11.17} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\) is the information matrix. 11.9.3 Hypothesis Tests We consider testing the null hypothesis \\(H_0: h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\mathbf{d}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is a known vector of dimension \\(r \\times 1\\) and h(\\(\\cdot\\)) is known and differentiable. This testing framework encompasses the general linear hypothesis introduced in Chapter 4 as a special case. There are three general approaches for testing hypotheses, called the likelihood ratio, Wald and Rao tests. The Wald approach evaluates a function of the likelihood at \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\). The likelihood ratio approach uses \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}\\). Here, \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}\\) is the value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) that maximizes \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced})\\) under the constraint that \\(h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\mathbf{d}\\). The Rao approach also uses \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}\\) but determines it by maximizing \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) - \\boldsymbol \\lambda^{\\prime}(h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) -\\mathbf{d})\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol \\lambda\\) is a vector of Lagrange multipliers. Hence, Rao’s test is also called the Lagrange multiplier test. The test statistics associated with the three approaches are: \\(LRT = 2 \\times \\left\\{L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE})-L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}) \\right\\}\\) Wald: \\(TS_W(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE})\\), where \\[ TS_W(\\boldsymbol \\theta)=(h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) -\\mathbf{d})^{\\prime} \\left\\{ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} h(\\boldsymbol \\theta)^{\\prime} \\left(-\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right)^{-1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right\\}^{-1} (h(\\boldsymbol \\theta) -\\mathbf{d}), \\] and Rao: \\(TS_R(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced})\\), where \\[ TS_R(\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\left(-\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\theta) \\right)^{-1} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\theta} L(\\boldsymbol \\theta)^{\\prime}. \\] Under broad conditions, all three test statistics have large sample chi-square distributions with \\(r\\) degrees of freedom under \\(H_0\\). All three methods work well when the number of parameters is finite dimensional and the null hypothesis specifies that \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) is on the interior of the parameter space. The main advantage of the Wald statistic is that it only requires computation of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\) and not \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}\\). In contrast, the main advantage of the Rao statistic is that it only requires computation of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{Reduced}\\) and not \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\). In many applications, computation of \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}\\) is onerous. The likelihood ratio test is a direct extension of the partial \\(F\\)-test introduced in Chapter 4 - it allows one to directly compare nested models, a helpful technique in applications. 11.9.4 Information Criteria Likelihood ratio tests are useful for choosing between two models that are nested, that is, where one model is a subset of the other. How do we compare models when they are not nested? One way is to use the following information criteria. The distance between two probability distributions given by probability density functions \\(g\\) and \\(f_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\) can be summarized by \\[ \\mathrm{KL}(g,f_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) = \\mathrm{E}_g \\ln \\frac{g(y)}{f_{\\boldsymbol \\theta}(y)} . \\] This is the Kullback-Leibler distance. Here, we have indexed \\(f\\) by a vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). If we let the density function \\(g\\) be fixed at a hypothesized value, say \\(f_{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_0}\\), then minimizing \\(\\mathrm{KL}(f_{{\\boldsymbol \\theta}_0},f_{\\boldsymbol \\theta})\\) is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood. However, maximizing the likelihood does not impose sufficient structure on the problem because we know that we can always make the likelihood greater by introducing additional parameters. Thus, Akaike in 1974 showed that a reasonable alternative is to minimize \\[ AIC = -2 \\times L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}) + 2 \\times (number~of~parameters), \\] known as Akaike’s Information Criterion. Here, the additional term \\(2 \\times\\) \\((number~of~parameters)\\) is a penalty for the complexity of the model. With this penalty, one cannot improve upon the fit simply by introducing additional parameters. This statistic can be used when comparing several alternative models that are not necessarily nested. One picks the model that minimizes \\(AIC\\). If the models under consideration have the same number of parameters, this is equivalent to choosing the model that maximizes the log-likelihood. We remark that this definition is not uniformly adopted in the literature. For example, in time series analysis, the \\(AIC\\) is rescaled by the number of parameters. Other versions that provide finite sample corrections are also available in the literature. Schwarz in 1978 derived an alternative criterion using Bayesian methods. His measure is known as the Bayesian Information Criterion, defined as \\[ BIC = -2 \\times L(\\boldsymbol \\theta_{MLE}) + (number~of~parameters) \\times \\ln (number~of~observations), \\] This measure gives greater weight to the number of parameters. That is, other things being equal, \\(BIC\\) will suggest a more parsimonious model than \\(AIC\\). Like the adjusted coefficient of determination \\(R^2_a\\) that we have introduced in the regression literature, both \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\) provide measures of fit with a penalty for model complexity. In normal linear regression models, Section 5.6 pointed out that minimizing \\(AIC\\) is equivalent to minimizing \\(n \\ln s^2 + k\\). Another linear regression statistic that balances the goodness of fit and complexity of the model is Mallows \\(C_p\\) statistic. For \\(p\\) candidate variables in the model, this is defined as \\(C_p = (Error~SS)_p/s^2 - (n-2p).\\) See, for example, Cameron and Trivedi (1998) for references and further discussion of information criteria.

In this chapter, the dependent variable \\(y\\) is a count, taking on values 0, 1, 2 and so on, that describes a number of events. Count dependent variables form the basis of actuarial models of claims frequency. In other applications, a count dependent variable may be the number of accidents, the number of people retiring or the number of firms becoming insolvent. The chapter introduces Poisson regression, a model that includes explanatory variables with a Poisson distribution for counts. This fundamental model handles many datasets of interest to actuaries. However, with the Poisson distribution, the mean equals the variance, a limitation suggesting the need for more general distributions such as the negative binomial. Even the two parameter negative binomial can fail to capture some important features, motivating the need for even more complex models such as the “zero-inflated” and latent variable models introduced in this chapter. 12.1 Poisson Regression 12.1.1 Poisson Distribution A count random variable \\(y\\) is one that has outcomes on the non-negative integers, \\(j=0,1,2,...\\) The Poisson is a fundamental distribution used for counts that has probability mass function \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr \\left( y=j\\right) =\\frac{\\mu^j}{j!}e^{-\\mu },~~~j=0,1,2,... \\tag{12.1} \\end{equation}\\] It can be shown that \\(\\mathrm{E~} y =\\sum\\nolimits_{j=0}^{\\infty }j\\Pr \\left( y=j\\right) =\\mu\\), so we may interpret the parameter \\(\\mu\\) to be the mean of the distribution. Similarly, one can show that \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y =\\mu\\), so that the mean equals the variance for this distribution. An early application (Bortkiewicz, 1898) was based on using the Poisson distribution to represent the annual number of deaths in the Prussian army due to “mule kicks.” The distribution is still widely used as a model of the number of accidents, such as injuries in an industrial environment (for workers’ compensation coverage) and property damages in automobile insurance. Example: Singapore Automobile Data. These data are from a 1993 portfolio of \\(n=7,483\\) automobile insurance policies from a major insurance company in Singapore. The data will be described further in Section 12.2. Table 12.1 provides the distribution of the number of accidents. The dependent variable is the number of automobile accidents per policyholder. For this dataset, it turns out that the maximum number of accidents in a year was three. There were on average \\(\\overline{y}=0.06989\\) accidents per person.

Specifically, from equation (12.1) we can write the mass function as \\(\\mathrm{f}(y,\\mu) = \\mu^y e^{-\\mu} /y!,\\) and so the log-likelihood is \\[\\begin{equation} L(\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i,\\mu) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( -\\mu +y_i\\ln \\mu -\\ln y_i!\\right) . \\tag{12.2} \\end{equation}\\] It is straight-forward to show that the log-likelihood has a maximum at \\(\\widehat{\\mu }=\\overline{y}\\), the average claims count. Estimated probabilities, using equation (12.1) and \\(\\widehat{\\mu }= \\overline{y}\\), are denoted as \\(\\widehat{p}_j\\). We used these estimated probabilities in Table 12.1 when computing the fitted counts with \\(n=7,483\\). To compare observed and fitted counts, a widely used goodness of fit statistic is Pearson’s chi-square statistic, given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_j\\frac{\\left( n_j-n\\widehat{p}_j\\right)^2}{n\\widehat{p}_j}. \\tag{12.3} \\end{equation}\\] Under the null hypothesis that the Poisson distribution is a correct model, this statistic has a large sample chi-square distribution where the degrees of freedom is the number of cells minus one minus the number of estimated parameters. For the Singapore data in Table 12.1 , this is \\(df=5-1-1=3\\). It turns out the statistic is 41.98, indicating that this basic Poisson model is inadequate.

Thus, it is common to model the number of accidents per thousand vehicles or the number of homicides per million population. Further, we also consider instances where the units of exposure may be fractions. To illustrate, for our Singapore data, \\(E_i\\) will represent the fraction of the year that a policyholder had insurance coverage. The logic behind this is that the expected number of accidents is directly proportional to the length of coverage. (This can also be motivated by a probabilistic framework based on collections of Poisson distributed random variables known as Poisson processes, see, for example, Klugman et al., 2008). More generally, we wish to allow the mean to vary according to information contained in other explanatory variables. For the Poisson, it is customary to specify \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mu_i = \\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) . \\] Using the exponential function to map the systematic component \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) into the mean ensures that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i\\) will remain positive. Assuming the linearity of the regression coefficients allows for easy interpretation. Specifically, because \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{E~}y_i}{\\partial x_{ij}} \\times \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{E~}y_i} =\\beta_j, \\] we may interpret \\(\\beta_j\\) to be the proportional change in the mean per unit change in \\(x_{ij}\\). The function that connects the mean to the systematic component is known as the logarithmic link function, that is, \\(\\ln \\mu_i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). To incorporate exposures, one can always specify one of the explanatory variables to be \\(\\ln E_i\\) and restrict the corresponding regression coefficient to be 1. This term is known as an offset. With this convention, the link function is \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln \\mu_i=\\ln E_i+\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta. \\tag{12.4} \\end{equation}\\] Example: California Automobile Accidents. Weber (1971) provided the first application of Poisson regression to automobile accident frequencies in his study of California driving records. In one model, Weber examined the number of automobile accidents during 1963 of nearly 87,000 male drivers. His explanatory variables consisted of: \\(x_1\\) = the natural logarithm of the traffic density index of the county in which the driver resides, \\(x_2 =5/(age-13)\\) \\(x_3\\) = the number of countable convictions incurred during years 1961-62 \\(x_4\\) = the number of accident involvements incurred during years 1961-62 \\(x_5\\) = the number of noncountable convictions incurred during years 1961-62. Interestingly, in this early application, Weber achieved a satisfactory fit representing the mean as a linear combination of explanatory variables (\\(\\mathrm{E }~y_i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta\\)), not the exponentiated version as in equation (12.4) that is now commonly fit. 12.1.3 Estimation Maximum likelihood is the usual estimation technique for Poisson regression models. Using the logarithmic link function in equation (12.4), the log-likelihood is given by \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( -\\mu_i+y_i\\ln \\mu _i-\\ln y_i!\\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( -E_i\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) +y_i\\left( \\ln E_i+\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) -\\ln y_i!\\right) . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Setting the score function equal to zero yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\left. \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta}\\mathrm{L}(\\boldsymbol \\beta )\\right\\vert_{\\mathbf{\\beta =b}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-E_i\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b}\\right) \\right) \\mathbf{x} _i=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\widehat{\\mu }_i\\right) \\mathbf{x}_i= \\mathbf{0}, \\tag{12.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\widehat{\\mu }_i = E_i\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\mathbf{b} \\right)\\). Solving this equation (numerically) yields \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), the maximum likelihood estimator of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). From equation (12.5), we see that if a row of \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) is constant (corresponding to a constant intercept regression term), then the sum of residuals \\(y_i - \\widehat{\\mu}_i\\) is zero. Taking second derivatives yields the information matrix, \\[ \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = - \\mathrm{E} \\frac{\\partial ^2}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta^{\\prime }}\\mathrm{L}(\\boldsymbol \\beta)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}E_i\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\boldsymbol \\beta\\right) \\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_i\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }. \\] Standard maximum likelihood estimation theory (Section 11.9.2) shows that the asymptotic variance-covariance matrix of \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is \\[ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}}=\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\widehat{\\mu } _i\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\right)^{-1}. \\] The square root of the \\(j\\)th diagonal element of \\(\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var~} \\mathbf{b}}\\) yields the standard error for \\(b_j\\), which we denote as \\(se(b_j)\\). Example: Medical Malpractice Insurance. Physicians make errors and may be sued by parties harmed by these errors. Like many professionals, it is common for physicians to carry insurance coverage that mitigates the financial consequences of “malpractice” lawsuits. Because insurers wish to accurately price this type of coverage, it seems natural to ask what type of physicians are likely to submit medical malpractice claims. Fournier and McInnes (2001) examined a sample of \\(n=9,059\\) Florida physicians using data from the Florida Medical Professional Liability Insurance Claims File. The authors examined closed claims in years 1985-1989 for physicians who were licensed before 1981, thus omitting claims for newly licensed physicians. Medical malpractice claims can take a long time to be resolved (“settled”); in their study, Fournier and McInnes found that 2 percent of claims were still not settled after 5 years of the malpractice event. Thus, they chose an early period (1985-1989) to allow the experience to mature. The authors also ignored minor claims by only considering claims that exceeded $100. Table 12.2 provides fitted Poisson regression coefficients along with standard errors that appear in Fournier and McInnes (2001). The table shows that physicians’ practice area, region, practice size and physician personal characteristics (experience and gender) to be important determinants of the number of medical malpractice suits. For example, we may interpret the coefficient associated with gender to say that males are expected to have \\(\\exp (0.432)= 1.540\\) times as many claims as females. Table 12.2.

This characteristic means that ordinary residuals \\(y_i-\\widehat{\\mu }_i\\) are of less use, so that it is more common to examine Pearson residuals defined as \\[ r_i=\\frac{y_i-\\widehat{\\mu }_i}{\\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mu }_i}}. \\] By construction, Pearson residuals are approximately homoscedastic. Plots of Pearson residuals can be used to identify unusual observations or to detect whether additional variables of interest can be used to improve the model specification. Pearson residuals can also be used to calculate a Pearson goodness of fit statistic, \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}r_i^2=\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\left( y_i- \\widehat{\\mu }_i\\right)^2}{\\widehat{\\mu }_i}. \\tag{12.6} \\end{equation}\\] This statistic is an overall measure of how well the model fits the data. If the model is specified correctly, then this statistic should be approximately \\(n-(k+1)\\). In general, Pearson goodness of fit statistics take the form \\(\\sum \\left( O-E\\right)^2/E\\), where \\(O\\) is some observed quantity and \\(E\\) is the corresponding estimated (expected) value based on a model. The statistic in equation (12.6) is computed at the observation level whereas the statistic in equation (12.3) was computed summarizing information over cells. In linear regression, the coefficient of determination \\(R^2\\) is a widely accepted goodness of fit measure. In nonlinear regression such as for binary and count dependent variables, this is not true. Information statistics, such as Akaike’s Information Criterion, \\[ AIC=-2 L(\\mathbf{b}) +2(k+1), \\] represents a type of statistic useful for goodness of fit that is broadly defined over a large range of models. Models with smaller values of \\(AIC\\) fit better, and are preferred. As noted in Section 12.1.3, \\(t\\)-statistics are regularly used for testing the significance of individual regression coefficients. For testing collections of regression coefficients, it is customary to use the likelihood ratio test. The likelihood ratio test is a well-known procedure for testing the null hypothesis \\(H_0:\\mathrm{h}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = \\mathbf{d}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{d}\\) is a known vector of dimension \\(r\\times 1\\) and \\(\\mathrm{h}(\\mathbf{.})\\) is known and differentiable function. This approach uses \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{Reduced}}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{Reduced}}\\) is the value of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) that maximizes \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\) under the restriction that \\(\\mathrm{h}(\\boldsymbol \\beta)=\\mathbf{d}\\). One computes the test statistic \\[\\begin{equation} LRT = 2 \\left( L(\\mathbf{b}) - L(\\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{Reduced}}) \\right) . \\tag{12.7} \\end{equation}\\] Under the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\), the test statistic \\(LRT\\) has an asymptotic chi-square distribution with \\(r\\) degrees of freedom. Thus, large values of \\(LRT\\) suggest that the null hypothesis is not valid. 12.2 Application: Singapore Automobile Insurance Frees and Valdez (2008) investigate hierarchical models of Singapore driving experience. Here we examine in detail a subset of their data, focussing on 1993 counts of automobile accidents. The purpose of the analysis is to understand the impact of vehicle and driver characteristics on accident experience. These relationships provide a foundation for an actuary working in ratemaking, that is, setting the price of insurance coverages. The data are from the General Insurance Association of Singapore, an organization consisting of general (property and casualty) insurers in Singapore (see the organization’s website: www.gia.org.sg). From this database, several characteristics were available to explain automobile accident frequency. These characteristics include vehicle variables, such as type and age, as well as person level variables, such as age, gender and prior driving experience. Table 12.3 summarizes these characteristics. knitr::kable(2, caption = &quot;Silly. Create a table just to update the counter...&quot;) Table 12.2: Silly. Create a table just to update the counter… x 2 Table 12.3: Description of Covariates Covariate Description Vehicle Type The type of vehicle being insured, either automobile (A) or other (O). Vehicle Age The age of the vehicle, in years, grouped into six categories. Gender The policyholder’s gender, either male or female Age The age of the policyholder, in years, grouped into seven categories. NCD No Claims Discount. This is based on the previous accident record of the policyholder. The higher the discount, the better is the prior accident record. Table 12.4 shows the effects of vehicle characteristics on claim count. The “Automobile” category has lower overall claims experience. The “Other” category consists primarily of (commercial) goods vehicles, as well as weekend and hire cars. The vehicle age shows nonlinear effects of the age of the vehicle. Here, we see low claims for new cars with initially increasing accident frequency over time. However, for vehicles in operation for long periods of time, the accident frequencies are relatively low. There are also some important interaction effects between vehicle type and age not shown here. Nonetheless, Table 12.4 clearly suggests the importance of these two variables on claim frequencies.

Person level characteristics were largely unavailable for commercial use vehicles and so Table 12.5 present summary statistics for only those observations having automobile coverage with the requisite gender and age information. When we restricted consideration to (private use) automobiles, relatively few policies did not contain gender and age information. Table 12.5 suggests that driving experience was roughly similar between males and females. This company insured very few young drivers, so the young male driver category that typically has extremely high accident rates in most automobiles studies is less important for these data. Nonetheless, Table 12.5 suggests strong age effects, with older drivers having better driver experience. Table 12.5 also demonstrates the importance of the no claims discounts (NCD). As anticipated, drivers with better previous driving records who enjoy a higher NCD have fewer accidents. Table 12.5: Effect of Personal Characteristics on Claims. Based on Sample with Auto = 1.

However, Table 12.6 summarizes a simpler fitted Poisson model with only additive effects. Table 12.6 shows that both vehicle age and no claims discount are important categories in that the \\(t\\)-ratios for many of the coefficients are statistically significant. The overall log-likelihood for this model is \\(L( \\mathbf{b}) =-1,776.730\\). Omitted reference levels are given in the footnote of Table 12.6 to help interpret the parameters. For example, for \\(NCD=0\\), we expect that a poor driver with \\(NCD=0\\) will have \\(\\exp (0.729)=2.07\\) times as many accidents as a comparable excellent driver with \\(NCD=50\\). In the same vein, we expect that a poor driver with \\(NCD=0\\) will have \\(\\exp (0.729-0.293)=1.55\\) times as many accidents as a comparable average driver with \\(NCD=20\\). Table 12.6.

For a more parsimonious model, one might consider removing the automobile, gender and age variables. Removing these seven variables results in a model with a log-likelihood of \\(L \\left( \\mathbf{b}_{\\mathrm{Reduced}}\\right) =-1,779.420\\). To understand whether this is a significant reduction, we can compute a likelihood ratio statistic equation (12.7), \\[ LRT=2\\times \\left( -1,776.730 - (-1,779.420) \\right) =5.379. \\] Comparing this to a chi-square distribution with \\(df=7\\) degrees of freedom, the statistic \\(p\\)-value \\(=\\Pr \\left( \\chi _{7}^2&gt;5.379\\right) =0.618\\) indicates that these variables are not statistically significant. Nonetheless, for purposes of further model development, we retained automobile, gender and age as it is customary to include these variables in ratemaking models. As described in Section 12.1.4, there are several ways of assessing a model’s overall goodness of fit. Table 12.7 compares several fitted models, providing fitted values for each response level and summarizing the overall fit with Pearson chi-square goodness of fit statistics. The left portion of the table repeats the baseline information that appeared in Table 12.1, for convenience. To begin, first note that even without covariates, the inclusion of the offset, exposures, dramatically improves the fit of the model. This is intuitively appealing; as a driver has more insurance coverage during a year, he or she is more likely to be in an accident covered under the insurance contract. Table 12.7 also shows the improvement in the overall fit when including the fitted model summarized in Table 12.6. When compared to a chi-square distribution, the statistic \\(p\\)-value \\(=\\Pr \\left( \\chi_{4}^2&gt;8.77\\right) =0.067\\) suggests agreement between the data and the fitted value. However, this model specification can be improved - the following section introduces a negative binomial model that proves to be a yet better fit for this data set. Table 12.7.

In particular, the requirement that the mean equal the variance, known as equidispersion, is not satisfied for many datasets of interest. If the variance exceeds the mean, then the data are said to be overdispersed. A less common case occurs when the variance is less than the mean, known as underdispersion. Adjusting Standard Errors for Data not Equidispersed To mitigate this concern, a common specification is to assume that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\phi \\mu_i, \\tag{12.8} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\phi &gt;0\\) is a parameter to accommodate the potential over- or under-dispersion. As suggested by equation (12.5), consistent estimation of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) requires only that the mean function be specified correctly, not that the equidispersion or Poisson distribution assumptions hold. This feature also holds for linear regression. Because of this, the estimator \\(\\mathbf{b}\\) is sometimes referred to as a quasi-likelihood estimator. With this estimator, we may compute estimated means \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_i\\) and then estimate \\(\\phi\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\phi }=\\frac{1}{n-(k+1)}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\left( y_i- \\widehat{\\mu }_i\\right)^2}{\\widehat{\\mu }_i}. \\tag{12.9} \\end{equation}\\] Standard errors are then based on \\[ \\widehat{\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}}=\\left( \\widehat{\\phi }\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\widehat{\\mu }_i\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\right)^{-1}. \\] A drawback of equation (12.8) is that one assumes the variance of each observation is a constant multiple of its mean. For datasets where this assumption is in doubt, it is common to use a robust standard error, computed as the square root of the diagonal element of \\[ \\mathrm{Var~}\\mathbf{b}=\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_i\\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\right)^{-1}\\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left( y_i-\\mu_i\\right)^2\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\right) \\left( \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\mu_i\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\right)^{-1}, \\] evaluated at \\(\\widehat{\\mu }_i.\\) Here, the idea is that \\(\\left( y_i-\\mu_i\\right)^2\\) is an unbiased estimator of Var \\(y_i\\), regardless of the form. Although \\(\\left( y_i-\\mu_i\\right)^2\\) is a poor estimator of Var \\(y_i\\) for each observation \\(i\\), the weighted sum \\(\\sum\\nolimits_i\\left( y_i-\\mu_i\\right)^2\\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x} _i^{\\prime }\\) is a reliable estimator of \\(\\sum\\nolimits_i\\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) \\mathbf{x}_i\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime }\\). For the quasi-likelihood estimator, the estimation strategy assumes only a correct specification of the mean and uses a more robust specification of the variance than implied by the Poisson distribution. The advantage and disadvantage of this estimator is that it is not linked to a full distribution. This assumption makes it difficult, for example, if the interest is in estimating the probability of zero counts. An alternative approach is to assume a more flexible parametric model that permits a wider range of dispersion. Negative Binomial A widely used model for counts is the negative binomial, with probability mass function \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{Pr}(y=j)=\\left( \\begin{array}{c} j+r-1 \\\\ r-1 \\end{array} \\right) p^{r}\\left( 1-p\\right)^j, \\tag{12.10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r\\) and \\(p\\) are parameters of the model. To help interpret the parameters of the model, straightforward calculations show that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y=r(1-p)/p\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y = r(1-p)/p^2.\\) The negative binomial has several important advantages when compared to the Poisson distribution. First, because there are two parameters describing the negative binomial distribution, it has greater flexibility for fitting data. Second, it can be shown that the Poisson is a limiting case of the negative binomial (by allowing \\(p\\rightarrow 1\\) and \\(r \\rightarrow 0\\) such that $rp $). In this sense, the Poisson is nested within the negative binomial distribution. Third, one can show that negative binomial distribution arises from a mixture of the Poisson variables. For example, think about the Singapore data set with each driver having their own value of \\(\\lambda\\). Conditional on \\(\\lambda\\), assume that the driver’s accident distribution has a Poisson distribution with parameter \\(\\lambda\\). Further assume that the distribution of \\(\\lambda\\)’s can be described as a gamma distribution. Then, it can be shown that the overall accident counts have a negative binomial distribution. See, for example, Klugman et al. (2008). Such “mixture” interpretations are helpful in explaining results to consumers of actuarial analyses. For regression modeling, the “\\(p\\)” parameter varies by subject \\(i\\). It is customary to reparameterize the model and use a log-link function such that \\(\\sigma =1/r\\) and that \\(p_i\\) related to the mean through \\(\\mu_i =r(1-p_i)/p_i = \\exp (\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta)\\). Because the negative binomial is a probability frequency distribution, there is no difficulty in estimating features of this distribution, such as the probability of zero counts, after a regression fit. This is in contrast to the quasi-likelihood estimation of a Poisson model with an ad hoc specification of the variance summarized in equation (12.9). Example: Singapore Automobile Data - Continued. The negative binomial distribution was fit to the Section 12.2 Singapore data using the set of covariates summarized in Table 12.6. The resulting log-likelihood was \\(\\mathrm{L}_{NegBin}(\\mathbf{b})=-1,774.494;\\) this is larger than the Poisson likelihood fit \\(\\mathrm{L}_{Poisson}\\left( \\mathbf{b} \\right) =-1,776.730\\) because of an additional parameter. The usual likelihood ratio test is not formally appropriate because the models are only nested in a limiting sense. It is more useful to compare the goodness of fit statistics given in Table 12.7. Here, we see that the negative binomial is a better fit than the Poisson (with the same systematic components). A chi-square test of whether the negative binomial with covariates is suitable yields \\(p\\)-value\\(=\\Pr \\left( \\chi_{4}^2&gt;1.79\\right) =0.774\\), suggesting strong agreement between the observed data and fitted values. We interpret the findings of Table 12.7 to mean that the negative binomial distribution well captures the heterogeneity in the accident frequency distribution.

In principle, each frequency model could be used in a regression context by simply incorporating a systematic component, \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\), into one or more model parameters. However, analysts have found that four variations of the basic models perform well in fitting models to data and provide an intuitive platform for interpreting model results. 12.4.1 Zero-Inflated Models For many datasets, a troublesome aspect is the “excess” number of zeros, relative to a specified model. For example, this could occur in automobile claims data because insureds are reluctant to report claims, fearing that a reported claim will result in higher future insurance premiums. Thus, we have a higher than anticipated number of zeros due to the non-reporting of claims. A zero-inflated model represents the claims number \\(y_i\\) as a mixture of a point mass at zero and another claims frequency distribution, say \\(g_i(j)\\) (which is typically Poisson or negative binomial). (We might interpret the point mass as the tendency of non-reporting.) The probability of getting the point mass would be modeled by a binary count model such as, for example, the logit model \\[ \\pi_i=\\frac{\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta _{1}\\right) }{1+\\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta _{1}\\right) }. \\] As a consequence of the mixture assumption, the zero-inflated count distribution can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr \\left( y_i=j\\right) =\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\pi_i+(1-\\pi_i)g_i(0) &amp; j=0 \\\\ (1-\\pi_i)g_i(j) &amp; j=1,2,... \\end{array} \\right. . \\tag{12.11} \\end{equation}\\] From equation (12.11), we see that zeros could arise from either the point mass or the other claims frequency distribution. To see the effects of a zero-inflated model, suppose that \\(g_i\\) follows a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\mu_i\\). Then, easy calculations show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~} y_i = (1 - \\pi_i) \\mu_i \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var~} y_i = \\pi_i \\mu_i+\\pi_i\\mu_i^2(1-\\pi_i). \\] Thus, for the zero-inflated Poisson, the variance always exceeds the mean, thus accommodating overdispersion relative to the Poisson model. Example: Automobile Insurance. Yip and Yau (2005) examine a portfolio of \\(n=2,812\\) automobile policies available from SAS Institute, Inc.  Explanatory variables include age, gender, marital status, annual income, job category and education level of the policyholder. For this dataset, they found that several zero-inflated count models accommodated well the presence of extra zeros. 12.4.2 Hurdle Models A “hurdle model” provides another mechanism to modify basic count distributions in order to represent situations with an excess number of zeros. Hurdle models can be motivated by sequential decision making processes confronted by individuals. For example, in healthcare choice, we can think about an individual’s decision to seek healthcare care as an initial process. Conditional on having sought healthcare \\(\\{y\\geq 1\\}\\), the amount of healthcare is a decision made by a healthcare provider (such as a physician or hospital), thus representing a different process. One needs to pass the first “hurdle” (the decision to seek healthcare) in order to address the second (the amount of healthcare). An appeal of the hurdle model is its connection to the “principal-agent” model where the provider (agent) decides on the amount after initial contact by the insured (principal) is made. As another example, in property and casualty insurance, the decision process an insured uses for reporting the initial claim may differ from that used for reporting subsequent claims. To represent hurdle models, let \\(\\pi_i\\) represent the probability that $ {y_i=0}$ used for the first decision and suppose that \\(g_i\\) represents the count distribution that will be used for the second decision. We define the probability mass function as \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr \\left( y_i=j\\right) =\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} \\pi_i &amp; j=0 \\\\ k_ig_i(j) &amp; j=1,2,... \\end{array} \\right. . \\tag{12.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(k_i=(1-\\pi_i)/(1-g_i(0))\\). As with zero-inflated models, a logit model might be suitable for representing \\(\\pi_i\\). To see the effects of a hurdle model, suppose that \\(g_i\\) follows a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\mu_i\\). Then, easy calculations show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~} y_i =k_i \\mu_i \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var~} y_i = k_i \\mu_i + k_i \\mu_i^2(1-k_i). \\] Because \\(k_i\\) may be larger or smaller than 1, this model allows for both under- and overdispersion relative to the Poisson model. The hurdle model is a special case of the “two-part” model described in Chapter 16. There, we will see that for two-part models, the amount of healthcare utilized may be a continuous as well as a count variable. An appeal of two-part models is that parameters for each hurdle/part can be analyzed separately. Specifically, the log-likelihood for the i\\(th\\) subject can be written as \\[ \\ln \\left[ \\Pr \\left( y_i=j\\right) \\right] =\\left[ \\mathrm{I}(j=0)\\ln \\pi_i+\\mathrm{I}(j\\geq 1)\\ln (1-\\pi_i)\\right] +\\mathrm{I}(j\\geq 1)\\ln \\frac{g_i(j)}{(1-g_i(0))}. \\] The terms in the square brackets on the right-hand side correspond to the likelihood for a binary count model. The latter terms correspond to a count model with zeros removed (known as a truncated model). If the parameters for the two pieces are different (“separable”), then the maximization may be done separately for each part. 12.4.3 Heterogeneity Models In a heterogeneity model, one allows one or more model parameters to vary randomly. The motivation is that these random parameters capture unobserved features of a subject. For example, suppose that \\(\\alpha_i\\) represents a random parameter and that \\(y_i\\) given \\(\\alpha_i\\) has conditional mean \\(\\exp \\left( \\alpha_i+\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta \\right)\\). We interpret \\(\\alpha_i\\), called a heterogeneity component, to represent unobserved subject characteristics that contribute linearly to the systematic component \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). To see the effects of the heterogeneity component on the count distribution, basic calculations show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~} y_i = \\exp \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta \\right) =\\mu_i \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var~} y_i = \\mu_i + \\mu_i^2 \\mathrm{Var}\\left( e^{\\alpha_i}\\right) . \\] where we typically assume that \\(\\mathrm{E}\\left( e^{\\alpha _i}\\right) =1\\) for parameter identification. Thus, heterogeneity models readily accommodate overdispersion in datasets. It is common to assume that the count distribution is Poisson conditional on \\(\\alpha_i\\). There are several choices for the distribution of \\(\\alpha_i\\), the two most common being the log-gamma and the log-normal. For the former, one first assumes that $ ( _i) $ has a gamma distribution, implying that $( _i + _i^{} ) $ also has a gamma distribution. Recall that we have already noted in Section 12.3 that using a gamma mixing distribution for Poisson counts results in a negative binomial distribution. Thus, this choice provides another motivation for the popularity of the negative binomial as the choice of the count distribution. For the latter, assuming that an observed quantity such as $( _i) $ has a normal distribution is quite common in applied data analysis. Although there are no closed-form analytic expressions for the resulting marginal count distribution, there are several software packages that readily lend itself to ease computational difficulties. The heterogeneity component is particularly useful in repeated samples where it can be used to model clustering of observations. Observations from different clusters tend to be dissimilar compared to observations within a cluster, a feature known as “heterogeneity.” The similarity of observations within a cluster can be captured by a common term \\(\\alpha_i\\). Different heterogeneity terms from observations from different clusters can capture the heterogeneity. For an introduction to modeling from repeated sampling, see Chapter 10. Example: Spanish Third Party Automobile Liability Insurance. Boucher et al. (2006) analyzed a portfolio of \\(n=548,830\\) automobile contracts from a major insurance company operating in Spain. Claims were for third party automobile liability, so that in the event of an automobile accident, the amount that the insured is liable for non-property damages to other parties is covered under the insurance contract. For these data, the average claims frequency was approximately 6.9%. Explanatory variables include age, gender, driving location, driving experience, engine size and policy type. The paper considers a wide variety of zero-inflated, hurdle and heterogeneity models, showing that each was a substantial improvement over the basic Poisson model. 12.4.4 Latent Class Models In most data sets, it is easy to think about classifications of subjects that the analyst would like to make in order to promote homogeneity among observations. Some examples include: “healthy” and “ill” people when examining healthcare expenditures, automobile drivers who are likely to file a claim in the event of an accident compared to those who are reluctant to do so and physicians who are “low” risks compared to “high” risks when examining medical malpractice insurance coverage. For many datasets of interests, such obvious classification information is not available and are said to be unobserved, or latent. A “latent class” model still employs this classification idea but treats it as an unknown discrete random variable. Thus, like Sections 12.4.1-12.4.3, we use mixture models to modify basic count distributions but now assume that the mixture is a discrete random variable that we interpret to be the latent class. To be specific, assume that we have two classes, “low-risk” and “high-risks,” with probability \\(\\pi_{L}\\) that a subject belongs to the low-risk class. Then, we can write the probability mass function as \\[\\begin{equation} \\Pr \\left( y_i=j\\right) =\\pi_{L}\\Pr \\left( y_i=j;L\\right) +\\left( 1-\\pi_{L}\\right) \\Pr \\left( y_i=j;H\\right) , \\tag{12.13} \\end{equation}\\] where $( y_i=j;L) $ and $( y_i=j;H) $ are the probability mass functions for the low and high risks, respectively. This model is intuitively pleasing in that corresponds to an analyst’s perception of the behavior of the world. It is flexible in the sense that the model readily accommodates under- and over-dispersion, long-tails and bi-modal distributions. However, this flexibility also leads to difficulty regarding computational issues. There is a possibility of multiple local maxima when estimating via maximum likelihood. Convergence can be slow compared to other methods described in 12.4.1-12.4.3. Nonetheless, latent class models have proven fruitful in applications of interest to actuaries. Example: Rand Health Insurance Experiment. Deb and Trivedi (2002) find strong evidence that a latent class model performs well when compared to the hurdle model. They examined counts of utilization of healthcare expenditures for the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, a dataset that has extensively analyzed in the health economics literature. They interpreted $( y_i=j;L) $ to be a distribution of infrequent healthcare users and $( y_i=j;H) $ to be a distribution of  frequent healthcare users. Each distribution was based on a negative binomial distribution, with different parameters for each class. They found statistically significant differences for their four insurance variables, two coinsurance variables, a variable indicating whether there was an individual deductible and a variable describing the maximum limit reimbursed. Because subjects were randomly assigned to insurance plans (very unusual), the effects of insurance variables on healthcare utilization are particularly interesting from a policy standpoint, as are differences among low and high use subjects. For their data, they estimated that approximately 20% were in the high use class. 12.5 Further Reading and References The Poisson distribution was derived by Poisson (1837) as a limiting case of the binomial distribution. Greenwood and Yule (1920) derived the negative binomial distribution as a mixture of a Poisson with a gamma distribution. Interestingly, one example of the 1920 paper was to use the Poisson distribution as a model of accidents, with the mean as a gamma random variable, reflecting the variation of workers in a population. Greenwood and Yule referred to this as individuals subject to “repeated accidents” that other authors have dubbed as “accident-proneness.” The first application of Poisson regression is due to Cochran (1940) in the context of ANOVA modeling and to Jorgensen (1961) in the context of multiple linear regression. As described in Section 12.2, Weber (1971) gives the first application to automobile accidents. This chapter focuses on insurance and risk management applications of count models. For those interested in automobiles, there is a related literature on studies of motor vehicle crash process, see for example, Lord et al. (2005).

Medical Expenditures Data. This exercise considers data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) described in Exercise 1.1 and Section 11.4. Our dependent variable consists of the number of outpatient (COUNTOP) visits. For MEPS, outpatient events include hospital outpatient department visits, office-based provider visits and emergency room visits excluding dental services. (Dental services, compared to other types of health care services, are more predictable and occur in a more regular basis.) Hospital stays with the same date of admission and discharge, known as “zero-night stays,” were also included in outpatient counts and expenditures. (Payments associated with emergency room visits that immediately preceded an inpatient stay were included in the inpatient expenditures. Prescribed medicines that can be linked to hospital admissions were included in inpatient expenditures, not in outpatient utilization.) Consider the explanatory variables described in Section 11.4. Provide a table of counts, a histogram and summary statistics of COUNTOP. Note the shape of the distribution and the relationship between the sample mean and sample variance. Create tables of means of COUNTOP by level of GENDER, ethnicity, region, education, self-rated physical health, self-rated mental health, activity limitation, income and insurance. Do these tables suggest that these explanatory variables have an impact on COUNTOP? As a baseline, estimate a Poisson model without any explanatory variables and calculate a Pearson’s chi-square statistic for goodness of fit (at the individual level). Estimate a Poisson model using the explanatory variables in part (b). d(i). Comment briefly on the statistical significance of each variable. d(ii). Provide an interpretation for the GENDER coefficient. d(iii). Calculate a (individual-level) Pearson’s chi-square statistic for goodness of fit. Compare this to the one in part (b). Based on this statistic and the statistical significance of coefficients discussed in part d(i), which model do you prefer? d(iv). Re-estimate the model using the quasi-likelihood estimator of the dispersion parameter. How have your comments in part d(i) changed? Estimate a negative binomial model using the explanatory variables in part (d). e(i). Comment briefly on the statistical significance of each variable. e(ii). Calculate a (individual-level) Pearson’s chi-square statistic for goodness of fit. Compare this to the ones in parts (b) and (d). Which model do you prefer? Also cite the \\(AIC\\) statistic in your comparison. e(iii). Re-estimate the model, dropping the factor income. Use the likelihood ratio test to say whether income is a statistically significant factor. As a robustness check, estimate a logistic regression model using the explanatory variables in part (d). Do the signs and significance of the coefficients of this model fit give the same interpretation as with the negative binomial model in part (e)? 12.6 Two Population Poissons. We can express the two population problem in a regression context using one explanatory variable. Specifically, suppose that \\(x_i\\) only takes on the values 0 and 1. Out of the \\(n\\) observations, \\(n_0\\) take on the value \\(x=0\\). These \\(n_0\\) observations have an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_0\\). The remaining \\(n_1 =n-n_0\\) observations have value \\(x=1\\) and an average \\(y\\) value of \\(\\overline{y}_1\\). Use the Poisson model with the logarithmic link function and systematic component \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 x_i\\). Determine the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), respectively. Suppose that \\(n_0 = 10\\), \\(n_1= 90\\), \\(\\overline{y}_0 = 0.20\\) and \\(\\overline{y}_1= 0.05\\). Using your results in part a(i), compute the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\), respectively. Determine the information matrix.

This chapter describes a unifying framework for the Part I linear model and the binary and count models in Chapters 11 and 12. Generalized linear models, often known by the acronym GLM, represent an important class of nonlinear regression models that have found extensive use in actuarial practice. This unifying framework not only encompasses many models we have seen but also provides a platform for new ones, including gamma regressions for fat-tailed data and “Tweedie” distributions for two-part data. 13.1 Introduction There are many ways to extend, or generalize, the linear regression model. This chapter introduces an extension that is so widely used that it is known as the “generalized linear model,” or as the acronym GLM. Generalized linear models include linear, logistic and Poisson regressions, all as special cases. One common feature of these models is that in each case we can express the mean response as a function of linear combinations of explanatory variables. In the GLM context, it is customary to use \\(\\mu_i = \\mathrm{E}~y_i\\) for the mean response and call \\(\\eta_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\) the systematic component of the model. We have seen that we can express the systematic component as: \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}}\\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mu_i\\), for (normal) linear regression, \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\exp(\\mu_i)/(1+\\exp(\\mu_i)),\\) for logistic regression and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\ln (\\mu_i),\\) for Poisson regression. For GLMs, the systematic component is related to the mean through the expression \\[\\begin{equation} \\eta _i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathrm{g}\\left( \\mu _i\\right). \\tag{13.1} \\end{equation}\\] Here, g(.) is known and called the link function. The inverse of the link function, \\(\\mu _i = \\mathrm{g}^{-1}( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta)\\), is the mean function. The second common feature involves the distribution of the dependent variables. In Section 13.2, we will introduce the linear exponential family of distributions, an extension of the exponential distribution. This family includes the normal, Bernoulli and Poisson distributions as special cases. The third common feature of GLM models is the robustness of inference to the choice of distributions. Although linear regression is motivated by normal distribution theory, we have seen that responses need not be normally distributed for statistical inference procedures to be effective. The Section 3.2 sampling assumptions focus on: the form of the mean function (assumption F1), non-stochastic or exogenous explanatory variables (F2), constant variance (F3) and independence among observations (F4). GLM models maintain assumptions F2 and F4 and generalize F1 through the link function. The choice of different distributions allows us to relax F3 by specifying the variance to be a function of the mean, written as \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_i = \\phi v(\\mu_i)\\). Table 13.1 shows how the variance depends on the mean for different distributions. As we will see when considering estimation (Section 13.3), it is the choice of the variance function that drives the most important inference properties, not the choice of the distribution. Table 13.1. Variance Functions for Selected Distributions \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{lc} \\hline \\text{Distribution} &amp; \\text{Variance Function }v(\\mu) \\\\ \\hline \\text{Normal} &amp; 1 \\\\ \\text{Bernoulli} &amp; \\mu ( 1- \\mu ) \\\\ \\text{Poisson} &amp; \\mu \\\\ \\text{Gamma }&amp; \\mu ^2 \\\\ \\text{Inverse Gaussian} &amp; \\mu ^3 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] By considering regression in the GLM context, we will be able to handle dependent variables that are approximately normally distributed, binary or representing counts, all within one framework. This will aid our understanding of regression by allowing us to see the “big picture” and not be so concerned with the details. Further, the generality of GLMs will allow us to introduce new applications, such as gamma regressions that are useful for fat-tailed distributions and the so-called “Tweedie” distributions for two-part data. Two-part data is a topic taken up in Chapter 16, where there is a mass at zero and a continuous component. For insurance claims data, the zero represents no claim and the continuous component represents the amount of a claim. This chapter describes estimation procedures for calibrating GLM models, significance tests and goodness of fit statistics for documenting the usefulness of the model, and residuals for assessing the robustness of the model fit. We will see that the our earlier work done on linear, binary and count regression models provides the foundations for the tools needed for the GLM model. Indeed, many are slight variations of tools and concepts developed earlier in this text and we will be able to build on these foundations. 13.2 GLM Model To specify a GLM, the analyst chooses an underlying response distribution, the topic of Section 13.2.1, and a function that links the mean response to the covariates, the topic of Section 13.2.2. 13.2.1 Linear Exponential Family of Distributions Definition. The distribution of the linear exponential family is \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{f}( y; \\theta ,\\phi ) =\\exp \\left( \\frac{y\\theta -b(\\theta )}{\\phi } +S\\left( y,\\phi \\right) \\right). \\tag{13.2} \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(y\\) is a dependent variable and \\(\\theta\\) is the parameter of interest. The quantity \\(\\phi\\) is a scale parameter. The term \\(b(\\theta )\\) depends only on the parameter \\(\\theta\\), not the dependent variable. The statistic \\(S\\left( y,\\phi \\right)\\) is a function of the dependent variable and the scale parameter, not the parameter \\(\\theta\\). The dependent variable \\(y\\) may be discrete, continuous or a mixture. Thus, \\(\\mathrm{f} \\left( .\\right)\\) may be interpreted to be a density or mass function, depending on the application. Table 13.8 provides several examples, including the normal, binomial and Poisson distributions. To illustrate, consider a normal distribution with a probability density function of the form \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{f}( y; \\mu ,\\sigma ^{2}) &amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( - \\frac{(y-\\mu )^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}\\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp;\\exp \\left( \\frac{(y\\mu -\\mu ^{2}/2)}{\\sigma ^{2}}-\\frac{y^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\ln \\left( 2\\pi \\sigma ^{2}\\right) \\right) . \\end{eqnarray*}\\] With the choices $=$, \\(\\phi =\\sigma ^{2}\\), \\(b(\\theta )=\\theta ^{2}/2\\) and \\(S\\left( y,\\phi \\right) =-y^{2}/(2\\phi )-\\ln \\left( 2\\pi \\phi \\right) /2\\), we see that the normal probability density function can be expressed as in equation (13.2). For the distribution in equation (13.2), some straightforward calculations show that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y=b^{\\prime }(\\theta )\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y=\\phi b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta )\\). For reference, these calculations appear in Section 13.9.2. To illustrate, in the context of the normal distribution example above, it is easy to check that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y=b^{\\prime }(\\theta )=\\theta =\\mu\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var~} y = \\sigma ^{2}b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta )=\\sigma ^{2}\\), as anticipated. In regression modeling situations, the distribution of \\(y_i\\) varies by observation through the subscript “\\(i\\)”. It is customary to let the distribution family remain constant yet allow the parameters to vary by observation through the notation \\(\\theta_i\\) and \\(\\phi_i\\). For our applications, the variation of the scale parameter is due to known weight factors. Specifically, when the scale parameter varies by observation, it is according to \\(\\phi _i=\\phi /w_i\\), that is, a constant divided by a known weight \\(w_i\\). With the relation \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\phi_i b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta_i)=\\phi b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta_i)/w_i\\), we have that a larger weight implies a smaller variance, other things being equal. 13.2.2 Link Functions In regression situations, we wish to understand the impact of \\(\\eta_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime}} \\boldsymbol \\beta\\), the systematic component. As we saw in the prior subsection, we can express the mean of \\(y_i\\) as \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i=\\mu _i=b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)\\). Equation (13.1) serves to “link” the systematic component to \\(\\mu_i\\) and thus to the parameter \\(\\theta_i\\). It is possible to use the identity function for g(.) so that \\(\\mu _i=b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)\\). Indeed, this is the usual case in linear regression. However, linear combinations of explanatory variables, \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\), may vary between negative and positive infinity whereas means are often restricted to smaller range. For example, Poisson means vary between zero and infinity. The link function serves to map the domain of the mean function onto the whole real line. Special Case: Links for the Bernoulli distribution. Bernoulli means are probabilities and thus vary between zero and one. For this case, it is useful to choose a link function that maps the unit interval (0,1) onto the whole real line. The following are three important examples of link functions for the Bernoulli distribution: Logit: \\(g(\\mu )=\\mathrm{logit}(\\mu )=\\ln (\\mu /(1-\\mu ))\\) . Probit: \\(g(\\mu )=\\Phi ^{-1}(\\mu )\\), where \\(\\Phi ^{-1}\\) is the inverse of the standard normal distribution function. Complementary log-log: $g()=( -(1-)) $. This illustration demonstrates that there may be several link functions that are suitable for a particular distribution. To help with the selection, an intuitively appealing case occurs when the systematic component equals the parameter of interest ($=$). To see this, first recall that $ =g()$ and \\(\\mu =b^{\\prime }(\\theta )\\), dropping the “\\(i\\)” subscripts for the moment. Then, it is easy to see that if \\(g^{-1}=b^{\\prime }\\), then $=g(b^{}())=$. The choice of \\(g\\) that is the inverse of \\(b^{\\prime }(\\theta )\\) is called the canonical link. Table Table 13.2 shows the mean function and corresponding canonical link for several important distributions. Table 13.2. Mean Functions and Canonical Links for Selected Distributions \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{lcc} \\hline \\text{Distribution} &amp; \\text{Mean function } b^{\\prime }(\\theta ) &amp; \\text{Canonical link }g(\\mu ) \\\\ \\hline \\text{Normal} &amp; \\theta &amp; \\mu \\\\ \\text{Bernoulli} &amp; e^{\\theta}/(1+e^{\\theta} ) &amp; \\mathrm{logit}(\\mu ) \\\\ \\text{Poisson} &amp; e^{\\theta } &amp; \\ln \\mu \\\\ \\text{Gamma} &amp; -1/\\theta &amp; -1/\\mu \\\\ \\text{Inverse Gaussian} &amp; (-2 \\theta )^{-1/2} &amp; -1 /(2 \\mu^2) \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Links relate the mean to the systematic component and to the regression parameters. Because the regression parameters are unknown, it is common to specify the links only up to scale. For example, it is common to specify the inverse gaussian canonical link as \\(1 /\\mu^2\\) (instead of $-1 /(2 ^2) $). If necessary, one can always recover the scale when estimating the unknown regression coefficients. Example: Ratemaking Classification. The process of grouping risks with similar characteristics is known as risk classification. Ratemaking is the art of setting premiums, or rates, based on loss experience and exposures of risk classes. For example, Mildenhall (1999) considered 8,942 collision losses from private passenger United Kingdom (UK) automobile insurance policies. The data were derived from Nelder and McCullagh (1989, Section 8.4.1) but originated from Baxter et al. (1980). A typical personal auto rating plan is based on driver and vehicle characteristics. Driver characteristics may include the driver’s age, gender, marital status, history (accidents and violations) and good student discount. Vehicle characteristics may include vehicle model type and year, purpose (business/school or pleasure), garage territory and so forth. We can represent the systematic component as \\[ \\eta_{ij} = \\beta_0 + \\alpha_i + \\tau_j, \\] where \\(\\alpha_i\\) represents the effect of the \\(i\\)th category of driver classification and \\(\\tau_j\\) the effect of the \\(j\\)th vehicle type. Table 13.3 displays the Mildenhall data for eight driver types (age groups) and four vehicle classes (vehicle use). The average severity is in pounds sterling adjusted for inflation. In GLM terminology, an additive rating plan is based on the identity link function whereas a multiplicative plan is based on a logarithmic link function. Specifically, if we use \\(\\eta_{ij} = \\ln ( \\mu _{ij})\\), then we can write the mean as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mu _{ij} = \\exp(\\beta_0 + \\alpha_i + \\tau_j) = B \\times A_i \\times T_j, \\tag{13.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(B=\\exp(\\beta_0)\\) is a scaling constant, \\(A_i=\\exp(\\alpha_i)\\) represents driver effects and \\(T_j=\\exp(\\tau_j)\\) represents vehicle effects.

To provide intuition, we focus on the simpler case of canonical links. Results for more general links appear in Section 13.9.3. 13.3.1 Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Canonical Links From equation (13.2) and the independence among observations, the log-likelihood is \\[\\begin{equation} \\ln \\mathrm{f}( \\mathbf{y}) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left\\{ \\frac{y_i\\theta_i-b(\\theta_i)}{\\phi _i}+S( y_i,\\phi _i ) \\right\\} . \\tag{13.4} \\end{equation}\\] Recall that for canonical links, we have equality between the distribution’s parameter and the systematic component, so that \\(\\theta_i=\\eta _i=\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\). Thus, with \\(\\phi _i=\\phi /w_i\\), the log-likelihood is \\[\\begin{equation} L (\\boldsymbol \\beta, \\phi ) = \\ln \\mathrm{f}( \\mathbf{y}) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left\\{ \\frac{y_i\\mathbf{x} _i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta-b(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }} \\boldsymbol \\beta)}{\\phi / w_i}+S( y_i,\\phi / w_i) \\right\\} . \\tag{13.5} \\end{equation}\\] Taking the partial derivative with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) yields the score function \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} L( \\boldsymbol \\beta, \\phi ) = \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left( y_i-b^{\\prime }(\\mathbf{x} _i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta) \\right) w_i \\mathbf{x}_i . \\tag{13.6} \\end{equation}\\] Because \\(\\mu _i=b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)=b^{\\prime }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{ \\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\), we can solve for the maximum likelihood estimators of \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\), $_{MLE} $, through the “normal equations” \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{0}=\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\left( y_i-\\mu _i\\right) \\mathbf{x}_i. \\tag{13.7} \\end{equation}\\] There are \\(k+1\\) equations and \\(k+1\\) unknowns in the equation (13.7). Typically, the solution is unique and we use the notation \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) to denote the solution. One reason for the widespread use of GLM methods is that the maximum likelihood estimators can be computed quickly through a technique known as iterated reweighted least squares, described in Section 13.9.4. Note that, like ordinary linear regression normal equations, we do not need to consider estimation of the variance scale parameter \\(\\phi\\) at this stage. That is, we can first compute \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) and, when necessary, estimate \\(\\phi\\). (\\(\\phi\\) is known for certain distributions such as the binomial and Poisson and so does not require estimation.) As described in Section 11.9, maximum likelihood estimators are consistent and have large sample normal distributions under broad conditions. Maximum likelihood inference provides a mechanism for calculating this distribution. From equations (13.6) and the likelihood technical supplement (Section 11.9, equation 11.14), the corresponding information matrix is \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{I} \\left( \\mathbf{b}_{MLE} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\phi}\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i ~b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\mathbf{x}_i ^{\\mathbf{\\prime }} \\mathbf{b}_{MLE} ) ~ \\mathbf{x}_i \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }} . \\tag{13.8} \\end{equation}\\] The inverse of the information matrix is the large sample variance-covariance matrix of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\). Specifically, the square root of the \\((j+1)\\)st diagonal element of the inverse of this matrix yields the standard error for \\(b_{j,MLE}\\), which we denote as \\(se(b_{j,MLE})\\). Extensions to general links are similar. Inference for \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) is robust to the choice of distributions in the following sense. The solution of the maximum likelihood estimators in equation (13.7) only depends on the mean function; it can be shown that consistency of the estimators depends only on proper choice of this function. Further, the large sample behavior of \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) essentially only requires that the mean and variance functions be correctly specified, not the choice of the distribution. (A few additional regularity conditions are required but these are mild technical requirements.) For example, suppose an analyst chooses a Poisson distribution with a logarithmic link. If the log link is appropriate, then only the equality between the mean and the variance is needed, see Table 13.1. Unlike the usual domain of the Poisson distribution, the dependent variables could be non-integers or even be negative. Large sample inference for \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) only requires that we choose the mean and variance functions correctly. Example: Ratemaking Classification - Continued. Using the data in Table 13.3, a log-link function with gamma distribution was fit using claim counts as weights (\\(w_i\\)). Table 13.4 shows estimates of the expected severity using equation (13.3). The averages suggest that young drivers (ages 17-20 and 21-24) have the highest claims. For vehicle use, those driving for pleasure had the lowest and those driving for business had the highest claims. Table 13.4.

In contrast, the normal distribution has a separate scale parameter. When fitting models to data with binary or count dependent variables, it is common to observe that the variance exceeds that anticipated by the fit of the mean parameters. This phenomenon is known as overdispersion. Several alternative probabilistic models are available to explain this phenomenon, depending on the application at hand. See Section 12.3 for an example and McCullagh and Nelder (1989) for a more detailed inventory. Although arriving at a satisfactory probabilistic model is the most desirable route, in many situations analysts are content to postulate an approximate model through the relation \\[ \\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\sigma ^{2}\\phi ~b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta_i)/w_i . \\] The parameter \\(\\phi\\) is specified through the choice of the distribution whereas the scale parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) allows for extra variability. For example, Table 13.8 shows that by specifying either the Bernoulli or Poisson distribution, we have \\(\\phi =1\\). Although the scale parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) allows for extra variability, it may also accommodate situations in which the variability is smaller than specified by the distributional form (although this situation is less common). Finally, note that for some distributions such as the normal distribution, the extra term is already incorporated in the \\(\\phi\\) parameter and thus serves no useful purpose. When the additional scale parameter \\(\\sigma ^{2}\\) is included, it is customary to estimate it by Pearson’s chi-square statistic divided by the error degrees of freedom. That is, \\[ \\widehat{\\sigma }^{2}=\\frac{1}{N-k} \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i\\frac{\\left( y_i-b^{\\prime }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\mathbf{b}_{MLE})\\right) ^{2}}{\\phi b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\mathbf{b} _{MLE})} . \\] As with the Poisson distribution in Section 12.3, another way of handling unusual variance patterns is through robust or empirical standard errors. Section 13.9.3 provides additional details. 13.3.3 Goodness of Fit Statistics In linear regression models, the most widely cited goodness of fit statistic is the \\(R^2\\) measure that is based on the decomposition \\[ \\sum_i \\left(y_i - \\overline{y} \\right)^2 = \\sum_i \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)^2 + \\sum_i \\left(\\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y}\\right)^2 + 2 \\times \\sum_i \\left(y_i - \\widehat{y}_i \\right)\\left(\\widehat{y}_i - \\overline{y}\\right). \\] In the language of Section 2.3, this decomposition is: \\[ \\textit{Total SS = Error SS + Regression SS + 2} \\times \\textit{Sum of Cross-Products} \\] The difficulty with nonlinear models is that the Sum of Cross-Products term rarely equals zero. Thus, one gets different statistics when defining \\(R^2\\) as (Regression SS/Total SS) as compared to (1-Error SS/Total SS). Section 11.3.2 described some alternative \\(R^2\\) measures that are sometimes cited in GLM settings. A widely cited goodness of fit measure is the Pearson chi-square statistic that was introduced in Section 12.1.4. In the GLM context, we suppose that \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mu_i\\), \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_i = \\phi v(\\mu_i)\\) is the variance function (as in the Table 13.1 examples) and that \\(\\widehat{\\mu}_i\\) is an estimator of \\(\\mu_i\\). Then, the Pearson chi-square statistic is defined as \\(\\sum_i \\left( y_i - \\widehat{\\mu}_i \\right)^2/\\ ( \\phi v(\\widehat{\\mu}_i))\\). As we have seen for Poisson models of count data, this formulation reduces to the form \\(\\sum_i \\left( y_i - \\widehat{\\mu}_i \\right)^2/\\widehat{\\mu}_i.\\) General information criteria, including \\(AIC\\) and \\(BIC\\), that were defined in Section 11.9 are also regularly cited in GLM studies. A goodness of fit measure that is specific to GLM modeling is the deviance statistic. To define this statistic, we work with the notion a saturated model where there are as many parameters as observations, \\(\\theta_i, i=1, \\ldots, n\\). A saturated model provides the best possible fit. With a parameter for each observation, we maximize the likelihood on an observation-by-observation basis. Thus, taking derivatives of logarithmic likelihood from equation (13.2) yields \\[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_i} \\ln \\mathrm{f}( y_i; \\theta_i ,\\phi ) = \\frac{y_i-b^{\\prime}(\\theta_i)}{\\phi}. \\] Setting this equal to zero yields the parameter estimate, say \\(\\theta_{i,SAT}\\), as the solution of \\(y_i=b^{\\prime}(\\theta_{i,Sat})\\). Letting \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta _{SAT}\\) be the vector of parameters, the likelihood \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\theta _{SAT})\\) is the largest possible value of the log-likelihood. Then, for a generic estimator \\(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\), the scaled deviance statistic is defined as \\[ \\mathbf{\\mathrm{D}}^{\\ast}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) = 2 \\times \\left( L(\\boldsymbol \\theta _{SAT}) - L(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}) \\right). \\] In linear exponential families, one multiplies by the scaling factor \\(\\phi\\) to define the deviance statistic, $() = ^{}() $. This multiplication actually removes the variance scaling factor from the definition of the statistic. It is straightforward to check that the deviance statistic reduces to the following forms for three special cases: Normal: \\(\\mathbf{\\mathrm{D}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\mu})= \\sum_i \\left( y_i - \\widehat \\mu _i \\right) ^2\\), Bernoulli: \\(\\mathbf{\\mathrm{D}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\pi})= \\sum_i \\left\\{ y_i \\ln \\frac {y_i}{\\widehat \\pi_i} + (1-y_i) \\ln \\frac {1-y_i}{1-\\widehat \\pi_i} \\right\\}\\), and Poisson: \\(\\mathbf{\\mathrm{D}}(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\mu})= \\sum_i \\left\\{ y_i \\ln \\frac {y_i}{\\widehat \\mu_i} + (y_i - \\widehat \\mu _i) \\right\\}\\). Here, we use the convention that \\(y \\ln y = 0\\) when \\(y = 0\\). 13.4 Application: Medical Expenditures We now return to the Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS) data introduced in Section 11.4. In that section, we sought to develop a model to understand the event of an inpatient admission to a hospital. In this section, we now wish to model the amount of the expenditure. In actuarial terminology, Section 11.4 considered the “frequency” whereas this section involves the “severity.” Out of the 2,000 randomly sampled observations from year 2003 considered in Section 11.4, only \\(n=157\\) were admitted to the hospital during the year. Table 13.5 summarizes the data using the same explanatory variables as in Table 11.4. For example, Table 13.5 shows that the sample is 72% female, almost 76% white and over 91% insured. The table also shows relatively few expenditures by Asians, Native Americans and the uninsured in our sample. Table 13.5 also gives median expenditures by categorical variable. This tables suggests that gender, a poor self-rating of physical health and income that is poor or negative may be important determinants of the amount of medical expenditures. Table 13.5.

This is evident in Figure 13.1 that provides a smooth histogram (known as a “kernel density estimate”, see Section 15.2) for inpatient expenditures. For skewed distributions, the median often provides a more helpful idea of the center of the distribution than the mean. The distribution is even more skewed than suggested by this figure because the largest expenditure (which is $607,800) is omitted from the graphical display. Figure 13.1: Smooth Empirical Histogram of Positive Inpatient Expenditures. The largest expenditure is omitted.

The results of this model fit appear in Table 13.6. Here, we see that many of the potentially important determinants of medical expenditures are not statistically significant. This is common in expenditure analysis, where variables help predict the frequency although are not as useful in explaining severity. Because of collinearity, we have seen in linear models that having too many variables in a fitted model can lead to statistical insignificance of important variables and even cause signs to be reversed. For a simpler model, we removed the Asian, Native American and the uninsured variables because they account for a small subset of our sample. We also used only the POOR variable for self-reported health status and only POORNEG for income, essentially reducing these categorical variables to binary variables. Table 13.6, under the heading “Reduced Model,” reports the result of this model fit. This model has almost the same goodness of fit statistic, \\(AIC\\), suggesting that it is a reasonable alternative. Under the reduced model fit, the variables COUNTIP (inpatient count), AGE, COLLEGE and POORNEG, are statistically significant variables. For these significant variables, the signs are intuitively appealing. For example, the positive coefficient associated with COUNTIP means that as the number of inpatient visits increases, the total expenditures increases, as anticipated. For another alternative model specification, Table 13.6 also shows a fit of an inverse gaussian model with a logarithmic link. From the \\(AIC\\) statistic, we see that this model does not fit nearly as well as the gamma regression model. All variables are statistically insignificant, making it difficult to interpret this model. Table 13.6.

This diagnostic method relies on residuals. In the linear model, we defined residuals as the response minus the corresponding fitted values. In a GLM context, we refer to these as “raw residuals,” denoted as \\(y_i - \\widehat{\\mu}_i\\). As we have seen, residuals are useful for: discovering new covariates or the effects of nonlinear patterns in existing covariates, identifying poorly fitting observations, quantifying the effects of individual observations on model parameters and revealing other model patterns, such as heteroscedasticity or time trends. As this section emphasizes, residuals are also the building blocks for many goodness of fit statistics. As we saw in Section 11.1 on binary dependent variables, analysis of raw residuals can be meaningless in some nonlinear contexts. Cox and Snell (1968, 1971) introduced a general notion of residuals that is more useful in nonlinear models than the simple raw residuals. For our applications, we assume that \\(y_i\\) has a distribution function F(\\(\\cdot\\)) that is indexed by explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and a vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) denoted as F(\\(\\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol \\theta\\)). Here, the distribution function is common to all observations but the distribution varies through the explanatory variables. The vector of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\) includes the regression parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) as well as scale parameters. With knowledge of F(\\(\\cdot\\)), we now assume that a new function R(\\(\\cdot\\)) can be computed such that \\(\\varepsilon_i = \\mathrm{R}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol \\theta)\\), where \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are identically and independently distributed. Here, the function R(\\(\\cdot\\)) depends on explanatory variables \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\). The Cox-Snell residuals are then \\(e_i = \\mathrm{R}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta})\\). If the model is well-specified and the parameter estimates \\(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol \\theta}\\) are close to the model parameters \\(\\boldsymbol \\theta\\), then the residuals \\(e_i\\) should be close to i.i.d. To illustrate, in the linear model we use the residual function \\(\\mathrm{R}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol \\theta) = y_i - \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta =y_i - \\mu_i = \\varepsilon_i,\\) resulting in (ordinary) raw residuals. Another choice is to rescale by the standard deviation \\[ \\mathrm{R}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\frac{y_i - \\mu_i}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var~} y_i}} , \\] that yields Pearson residuals. Another type of residual is based on a first transforming the response with a known function h(\\(\\cdot\\)), \\[ \\mathrm{R}(y_i; \\mathbf{x}_i,\\boldsymbol \\theta) = \\frac{\\mathrm{h}(y_i) - \\mathrm{E~} \\mathrm{h}(y_i)}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var~}\\mathrm{h}(y_i)}} . \\] Choosing the function so that h(\\(y_i\\)) is approximately normally distributed yields Anscombe residuals. Another popular choice is to choose the transform so that the variance is stabilized. Table 13.7 gives transforms for the binomial, Poisson and gamma distributions. Table 13.7.

Source: Pierce and Schafer (1986). Another widely used choice in GLM studies are deviance residuals, defined as \\[ \\mathrm{sign} \\left(y_i - \\widehat{\\mu}_i \\right) \\sqrt{2 \\left( \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i;\\theta_{i,SAT}) - \\ln \\mathrm{f}(y_i;\\widehat{\\theta}_{i}) \\right)}. \\] Section 13.3.3 introduced the parameter estimates of the saturated model, \\(\\theta_{i,SAT}\\). As discussed by Pierce and Schafer (1986), deviance residuals are very close to Anscombe residuals in many cases - we can check deviance residuals for approximate normality. Further, deviance residuals can be defined readily for any GLM model and are easy to compute. 13.6 Tweedie Distribution We have seen that the natural exponential family includes continuous distributions, such as the normal and gamma, as well as discrete distributions, such as the binomial and Poisson. It also includes distributions that are mixtures of discrete and continuous components. In insurance claims modeling, the most widely used mixture is the Tweedie (1984) distribution. It has a positive mass at zero representing no claims and a continuous component for positive values representing the amount of a claim. The Tweedie distribution is defined as a Poisson sum of gamma random variables, known as an aggregate loss in actuarial science. Specifically, suppose that \\(N\\) has a Poisson distribution with mean \\(\\lambda\\), representing the number of claims. Let {\\(y_j\\)} be an i.i.d. sequence, independent of \\(N\\), with each \\(y_j\\) having a gamma distribution with parameters \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\), representing the amount of a claim. Then, \\(S_N = y_1 + \\ldots + y_N\\) is Poisson sum of gammas. Section 16.5 will discuss aggregate loss models in further detail. This section focuses on the important special case of the Tweedie distribution. To understand the mixture aspect of the Tweedie distribution, first note that it is straightforward to compute the probability of zero claims as \\[ \\Pr ( S_N=0) = \\Pr (N=0) = e^{-\\lambda}. \\] The distribution function can be computed using conditional expectations, \\[ \\Pr ( S_N \\le y) = e^{-\\lambda}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\Pr(N=n) \\Pr(S_n \\le y), ~~~~~y \\geq 0. \\] Because the sum of i.i.d. gammas is a gamma, \\(S_n\\) (not \\(S_N\\)) has a gamma distribution with parameters \\(n\\alpha\\) and \\(\\gamma\\). Thus, for \\(y&gt;0\\), the density of the Tweedie distribution is \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{f}_{S}(y) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} e^{-\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda ^n}{n!} \\frac{\\gamma^{n \\alpha}}{\\Gamma(n \\alpha)} y^{n \\alpha -1} e^{-y \\gamma}. \\tag{13.9} \\end{equation}\\] At first glance, this density does not appear to be a member of the linear exponential family given in equation (13.2). To see the relationship, we first calculate the moments using iterated expectations as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E~}S_N = \\lambda \\frac{\\alpha}{\\gamma}~~~~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~~~ \\mathrm{Var~}S_N = \\frac{\\lambda \\alpha}{\\gamma^2} (1+\\alpha). \\tag{13.10} \\end{equation}\\] Now, define three parameters \\(\\mu, \\phi, p\\) through the relations \\[ \\lambda = \\frac{\\mu^{2-p}}{\\phi (2-p)},~~~~~~\\alpha = \\frac{2-p}{p-1}~~~~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~~~ \\frac{1}{\\gamma} = \\phi(p-1)\\mu^{p-1}. \\] Inserting these new parameters in equation (13.9) yields \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{f}_{S}(y) = \\exp \\left[ \\frac{-1}{\\phi} \\left( \\frac{\\mu^{2-p}}{2-p} + \\frac{y}{(p-1)\\mu^{p-1}} \\right) + S(y,\\phi) \\right]. \\tag{13.11} \\end{equation}\\] We leave the calculation of \\(S(y,\\phi)\\) as an exercise. Thus, the Tweedie distribution is a member of the linear exponential family. Easy calculations show that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathrm{E~}S_N = \\mu~~~~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~~~ \\mathrm{Var~}S_N = \\phi \\mu^p, \\tag{13.12} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(1&lt;p&lt;2.\\) Examining our variance function Table 13.1, the Tweedie distribution can also be viewed as a choice that is intermediate between the Poisson and the gamma distributions. 13.7 Further Reading and References A more extensive treatment of GLM may be found in the classic work by McCullagh and Nelder (1989) or the gentler introduction by Dobson (2002). de Jong and Heller (2008) provide a recent book-long introduction to GLMs with a special insurance emphasis. GLMs have enjoyed substantial attention from property and casualty (general) insurance practicing actuaries recently, see Anderson et al. (2004) and Clark and Thayer (2004) for introductions. Mildenhall (1999) provides a systematic analysis of the connection between GLM models and algorithms for assessing different rating plans. Fu and Wu (2008) provide an updated version, introducing a broader class of iterative algorithms that tie nicely to GLM models.

Further, verify the moments in equation (13.10). 13.9 Technical Supplements - Exponential Family 13.9.1 Linear Exponential Family of Distributions The distribution of the random variable \\(y\\) may be discrete, continuous or a mixture. Thus, f(.) in equation (13.2) may be interpreted to be a density or mass function, depending on the application. Table 13.8 provides several examples, including the normal, binomial and Poisson distributions. Table 13.8.

For simplicity, we assume that the random variable \\(y\\) is continuous. Define the moment generating function \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} M(s) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E}~ e^{sy} = \\int \\exp \\left( sy+ \\frac{y \\theta - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} + S(y, \\phi) \\right) dy \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\exp \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right) \\int \\exp \\left( \\frac{y(\\theta + s\\phi) - b(\\theta+s\\phi)}{\\phi} + S(y, \\phi) \\right) dy \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\exp \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right), \\end{eqnarray*}\\] because \\(\\int \\exp \\left( \\frac{1}{\\phi} \\left[ y(\\theta + s\\phi) - b(\\theta+s\\phi) \\right] + S(y, \\phi) \\right) dy=1\\). With this expression, we can generate the moments. Thus, for the mean, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{E}~ y &amp;=&amp; M^{\\prime}(0) = \\left . \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\exp \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right) \\right | _{s=0} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\left[ b^{\\prime}(\\theta + s \\phi ) \\exp \\left( \\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right) \\right] _{s=0} = b^{\\prime}(\\theta). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] Similarly, for the second moment, we have \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} M^{\\prime \\prime}(s) &amp;=&amp; \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s} \\left[ b^{\\prime}(\\theta + s \\phi) \\exp \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right) \\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\phi b^{\\prime \\prime}(\\theta + s \\phi) \\exp \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right) + (b^{\\prime}(\\theta + s \\phi))^2 \\left(\\frac{b(\\theta + s \\phi) - b(\\theta)}{\\phi} \\right). \\end{eqnarray*}\\] This yields \\(\\mathrm{E}y^2 = M^{\\prime \\prime}(0)\\) \\(= \\phi b^{\\prime \\prime}(\\theta) + (b^{\\prime}(\\theta))^2\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}~y =\\phi b^{\\prime \\prime}(\\theta)\\). 13.9.3 Maximum Likelihood Estimation for General Links For general links, we no longer assume the relationship \\(\\theta_i=\\mathbf{ x}_i^{\\mathbf{\\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) but assume that \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta\\) is related to \\(\\theta_i\\) through the relations \\(\\mu _i=b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)\\) and $_i^{}= g( _i) $. We continue to assume that the scale parameter varies by observation so that \\(\\phi_i = \\phi/w_i\\), where \\(w_i\\) is a known weight function. Using equation (13.4), we have that the \\(j\\)th element of the score function is \\[ \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\beta _{j}}\\ln \\mathrm{f}\\left( \\mathbf{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}} \\frac{y_i-\\mu _i}{\\phi _i} , \\] because \\(b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)=\\mu _i\\). Now, use the chain rule and the relation \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_i=\\phi _ib^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta_i)\\) to get \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}=\\frac{\\partial b^{\\prime }(\\theta_i)}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}=b^{\\prime \\prime }(\\theta_i)\\frac{ \\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Var~}y_i}{\\phi _i}\\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}. \\] Thus, we have \\[ \\frac{\\partial \\theta_i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}\\frac{1}{\\phi _i}=\\frac{ \\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{Var~}y_i}. \\] This yields \\[ \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\beta _{j}}\\ln \\mathrm{f}\\left( \\mathbf{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\beta _{j}}\\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) ^{-1}\\left( y_i-\\mu _i\\right) , \\] that we summarize as \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta } = \\frac{\\partial }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta }\\ln \\mathrm{f}\\left( \\mathbf{y}\\right) =\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta}\\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) ^{-1}\\left( y_i-\\mu _i\\right) , \\tag{13.13} \\end{equation}\\] which is known as the generalized estimating equations form. Solving for roots of the score equation \\(L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) = \\mathbf{0}\\) yield maximum likelihood estimates, \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\). In general, this requires iterative numerical methods. An exception is the following special case. Special Case. No Covariates. Suppose that \\(k=1\\) and that \\(x_i =1\\). Thus, \\(\\beta = \\eta = g(\\mu),\\) and \\(\\mu\\) does not depend on \\(i\\). Then, from the relation \\(\\mathrm{Var~}y_i = \\phi b^{\\prime \\prime}(\\theta)/w_i\\) and equation (13.13), the score function is \\[ \\frac{\\partial L( \\beta) }{\\partial \\beta } = \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial \\beta} ~ \\frac{1}{\\phi b^{\\prime \\prime}(\\theta)} \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i \\left( y_i-\\mu \\right) . \\] Setting this equal zero yields \\(\\overline{y}_w = \\sum_i w_i y_i / \\sum_i w_i = \\widehat{\\mu}_{MLE} = g^{-1}(b_{MLE})\\), or \\(b_{MLE}=g(\\overline{y}_w),\\) where \\(\\overline{y}_w\\) is a weighted average of \\(y\\)’s. For the information matrix, use the independence among subjects and equation (13.13) to get \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta) &amp;=&amp; \\mathrm{E~} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta } \\frac{\\partial L(\\boldsymbol \\beta) }{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ^{\\prime}} \\right) \\nonumber \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta}~\\mathrm{E} \\left( \\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) ^{-1}\\left( y_i-\\mu _i\\right)^2 \\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) ^{-1}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ^{\\prime}} \\nonumber \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} \\left( \\mathrm{Var~}y_i\\right) ^{-1} \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ^{\\prime}} . \\tag{13.14} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Taking the square root of the diagonal elements of the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{I}(\\boldsymbol \\beta)\\), after inserting parameter estimates in the mean and variance functions, yields model-based standard errors. For data where the correct specification of the variance component is in doubt, one replaces Var \\(y_i\\) by an unbiased estimate \\((y_i - \\mu_i)^2\\). The resulting estimator \\[ se(b_j) = \\sqrt{ jth~diagonal~element~of~ [\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta} (y_i - \\mu_i)^{-2} \\frac{\\partial \\mu _i}{\\partial \\boldsymbol \\beta ^{\\prime}} ]|_{\\boldsymbol \\beta = \\mathbf{b}_{MLE}}^{-1}} \\] is known as the empirical, or robust, standard error. 13.9.4 Iterated Reweighted Least Squares To see how general iterative methods work, we use the canonical link so that \\(\\eta_i = \\theta_i\\). Then, the score function is given in equation (13.6) and the Hessian is in equation (13.8).

Many data sets feature dependent variables that have a large proportion of zeros. This chapter introduces a standard econometric tool, known as a tobit model, for handling such data. The tobit model is based on observing a left-censored dependent variable, such as sales of a product or claim on a healthcare policy, where it is known that the dependent variable cannot be below zero. Although this standard tool can be useful, many actuarial data sets that feature a large proportion of zeros are better modeled in “two parts,” one part for the frequency and one part for the severity. This chapter introduces two-part models and provides extensions to an aggregate loss model, where a unit under study, such as an insurance policy, can result in more than one claim. 16.1 Introduction Many actuarial data sets come in “two parts:” One part for the frequency, indicating whether or not a claim has occurred or, more generally, the number of claims, and One part for the severity, indicating the amount of a claim. In predicting or estimating claims distributions, we often associate the cost of claims with two components: the event of the claim and its amount, if the claim occurs. Actuaries term these the claims frequency and severity components, respectively. This is the traditional way of decomposing “two-part” data, where one can think of a zero as arising from a policy without a claim (Bowers et al., 1997, Chapter 2). Because of this decomposition, two-part models are also known as frequency-severity models. However, this formulation has been traditionally used without covariates to explain either the frequency or severity components. In the econometrics literature, Cragg (1971) introduced covariates into these two components, citing an example from fire insurance. Healthcare data also often feature a large proportion of zeros that must be accounted for in the modeling. Zero values can represent an individual’s lack of healthcare utilization, no expenditure, or non-participation in a program. In healthcare, Mullahy (1998) cites some prominent areas of potential applicability: Outcomes research - amount of health care utilization or expenditures Demand for health care - amount of health care sought, such as the number of physician visits Substance abuse - amount consumed of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs. The two-part aspect can be obscured by a natural way of recording data; enter the amount of the claim when the claim occurs (a positive number) and a zero for no claim. It is easy to overlook a large proportion of zeros, particularly when the analyst is also concerned with many covariates that may help explain a dependent variable. As we will see in this chapter, ignoring the two-part nature can lead to serious bias. To illustrate, recall from Chapter 6 a plot of an individual’s income (\\(x\\)) versus the amount of insurance purchased (\\(y\\)) (Figure 6.3). Fitting a single line to these data would misinform users about the effects of \\(x\\) on \\(y\\). Figure 16.1: When individuals do not purchase insurance, they are recorded as \\(y=0\\) sales. The sample in this plot represents two subsamples, those who purchased insurance, corresponding to \\(y&gt;0\\), and those who did not, corresponding to \\(y=0\\). In contrast, many insurers keep separate data files for frequency and severity. For example, insurers maintain a “policyholder” file that is established when a policy is underwritten. This file records much underwriting information about the insured(s), such as age, gender, and prior claims experience, policy information such as coverage, deductibles, and limitations, as well as the insurance claims event. A separate file, often known as the “claims” file, records details of the claim against the insurer, including the amount. (There may also be a “payments” file that records the timing of the payments although we shall not deal with that here.) This recording process makes it natural for insurers to model the frequency and severity as separate processes. 16.2 Tobit Model One way of modeling a large proportion of zeros is to assume that the dependent variable is (left) censored at zero. This chapter introduces left-censored regression, beginning with the well-known tobit model that is based on the pioneering work of James Tobin (1958). Subsequently, Goldberger (1964) coined the phrase “tobit model,” acknowledging the work of Tobin and its similarity to the probit model. As with probit (and other binary response) models, we use an unobserved, or latent, variable \\(y^{\\ast}\\) that is assumed to follow a linear regression model of the form \\[ y_i^{\\ast} = \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\varepsilon_i. \\tag{16.1} \\] The responses are censored or “limited” in the sense that we observe \\(y_i = \\max \\left( y_i^{\\ast},d_i\\right)\\). The limiting value, \\(d_i\\), is a known amount. Many applications use \\(d_i=0\\), corresponding to zero sales or expenses, depending on the application. However, we also might use \\(d_i\\) for the daily expenses claimed for travel reimbursement and allow the reimbursement (such as $50 or $100) to vary by employee \\(i\\). Some readers may wish to review Section 14.2 for an introduction to censoring. The model parameters consist of the regression coefficients, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), and the variability term, \\(\\sigma^2 = \\mathrm{Var}~\\varepsilon_i\\). With equation (16.1), we interpret the regression coefficients as the marginal change of \\(\\mathrm{E~}y^{\\ast}\\) per unit change in each explanatory variable. This may be satisfactory in some applications, such as when \\(y^{\\ast}\\) represents an insurance loss. However, for most applications, users are typically interested in marginal changes in \\(\\mathrm{E~}y\\), that is, the expected value of the observed response. To interpret these marginal changes, it is customary to adopt the assumption of normality for the latent variable \\(y_i^{\\ast}\\) (or equivalently for the disturbance \\(\\varepsilon_i\\)). With this assumption, standard calculations (see Exercise 16.1) show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~}y_i = d_i + \\Phi \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i}{\\sigma}\\right) \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i + \\sigma \\lambda_i\\right), \\tag{16.2} \\] where \\[ \\lambda_i = \\frac{\\mathrm{\\phi}\\left( \\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i\\right)/\\sigma \\right)}{\\Phi\\left( \\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i\\right)/\\sigma \\right)}. \\] Here, \\(\\mathrm{\\phi}(.)\\) and \\(\\Phi(.)\\) are the standard normal density and distribution functions, respectively. The ratio of a probability density function to a cumulative distribution function is sometimes called an inverse Mills ratio. Although complex in appearance, equation (16.2) allows one to readily compute \\(\\mathrm{E~} y\\). For large values of \\(\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i\\right)/\\sigma\\), we see that \\(\\lambda_i\\) is close to 0 and \\(\\Phi\\left( \\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i\\right)/\\sigma \\right)\\) is close to 1. We interpret this to mean, for large values of the systematic component \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), that the regression function \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i\\) tends to be linear and the usual interpretations apply. The tobit model specification has the greatest impact on observations close to the limiting value \\(d_i\\). Equation (16.2) shows that if an analyst ignores the effects of censoring, then the regression function can be quite different than the typical linear regression function, \\(\\mathrm{E~}y=\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), resulting in biased estimates of coefficients. The other tempting path is to exclude limited observations (\\(y_i=d_i\\)) from the dataset and again run ordinary regression. However, standard calculations also show that \\[ \\mathrm{E~}\\left( y_i|\\ y_i&gt;d_i\\right) =\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\sigma \\frac{\\mathrm{\\phi}\\left( (\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i)/\\sigma \\right)}{1-\\Phi \\left( (\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i)/\\sigma \\right)} \\tag{16.3} \\] Thus, this procedure also results in biased regression coefficients. A commonly used method of estimating the tobit model is maximum likelihood. Employing the normality assumption, standard calculations show that the log-likelihood can be expressed as \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\ln L &amp;= \\sum\\limits_{i:y_i=d_i} \\ln \\left\\{ 1-\\Phi \\left( \\frac{\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} - d_i}{\\sigma}\\right) \\right\\} \\\\ &amp; - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum\\limits_{i:y_i&gt;d_i} \\left\\{ \\ln 2\\pi \\sigma^2 + \\frac{(y_i-(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}-d_i))^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right\\}, \\tag{16.4} \\end{array} \\] where \\(\\{i:y_i=d_i\\}\\) and \\(\\{i:y_i&gt;d_i\\}\\) means the sum over the censored and noncensored observations, respectively. Many statistical software packages can readily compute the maximum likelihood estimators, \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\) and \\(s_{MLE}\\), as well as corresponding standard errors. Section 11.9 introduces likelihood inference. For some users, it is convenient to have an algorithm that does not rely on specialized software. A two-stage algorithm due to Heckman (1976) fulfills this need. For this algorithm, first subtract \\(d_i\\) from each \\(y_i\\), so that one may take \\(d_i\\) to be zero without loss of generality. Even for those who wish to use the more efficient maximum likelihood estimators, Heckman’s algorithm can be useful in the model exploration stage as one uses linear regression to help select the appropriate form of the regression equation. Heckman’s Algorithm for Estimating Tobit Model Parameters For the first stage, define the binary variable \\[ r_i=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} 1 &amp; \\text{if } y_i&gt;0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{if } y_i=0 \\end{array} \\right. , \\] indicating whether or not the observation is censored. Run a probit regression using \\(r_i\\) as the dependent variable and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) as explanatory variables. Call the resulting regression coefficients \\(\\mathbf{g}_{PROBIT}\\). For each uncensored observation, compute the estimated variable \\[ \\widehat{\\lambda}_i=\\frac{\\mathrm{\\phi }\\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{g}_{PROBIT}\\right) }{\\Phi \\left( \\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime} \\mathbf{g}_{PROBIT}\\right) }, \\] an inverse Mill’s ratio. With this, run a regression of \\(y_i\\) on \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\lambda}_i\\). Call the resulting regression coefficients \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2SLS}\\). The idea behind this algorithm is that equation (16.1) has the same form as the probit model; thus, consistent estimates of the regression coefficients (up to scale) can be computed. The regression coefficients \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2SLS}\\) provide consistent and asymptotically normal estimates of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). They are, however, inefficient compared to the maximum likelihood estimators, \\(\\mathbf{b}_{MLE}\\). Standard calculations (see Exercise 16.1) show that \\(\\mathrm{Var~}\\left( y_i|\\ y_i&gt;d_i\\right)\\) depends on \\(i\\) (even when \\(d_i\\) is constant). Thus, it is customary to use heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors for \\(\\mathbf{b}_{2SLS}\\). 16.3 Application: Medical Expenditures This section considers data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) that were introduced in Section 11.4. Recall that MEPS is a probability survey that provides nationally representative estimates of health care use, expenditures, sources of payment, and insurance coverage for the U.S. civilian population. We consider MEPS data from the first panel of 2003 and take a random sample of \\(n=2,000\\) individuals between ages 18 and 65. Section 11.4 analyzed the frequency component, trying to understand the determinants that influenced whether or not people were hospitalized. Section 13.4 analyzed the severity component; given that a person was hospitalized, what are the determinants of medical expenditures? This chapter seeks to unify these two components into a single model of healthcare utilization. 16.3.0.1 Summary Statistics Table 16.1 reviews these explanatory variables and provides summary statistics that suggest their effects on expenditures of inpatient visits. The second column, “Average Expend,” displays the average logarithmic expenditure by explanatory variable, treating no expenditures as a zero (logarithmic) expenditure. This would be the primary variable of interest if one did not decompose the total expenditure into a discrete zero and continuous amount. Examining this overall average (logarithmic) expenditure, we see that females had higher expenditures than males. In terms of ethnicity, Native Americans and Asians had the lowest average expenditures. However, these two ethnic groups accounted for only 5.4% of the total sample size. Regarding regions, it appears that individuals from the West had the lowest average expenditures. In terms of education, more educated persons had lower expenditures. This observation supports the theory that more educated persons take more active roles in keeping their health. When it comes to self-rated health status, poorer physical, mental health, and activity-related limitations led to greater expenditures. Lower-income individuals had greater expenditures, and those with insurance coverage had greater average expenditures. Table 16.1 also describes the effects of explanatory variables on the frequency of utilization and average expenditures for those that used inpatient services. As in Table 11.4, the column “Percent Positive Expend” gives the percentage of individuals that had some positive expenditure, by explanatory variable. The column “Average of Pos Expend” gives the average (logarithmic) expenditure in cases where there was an expenditure, ignoring the zeros. This is comparable to the median expenditure in Table 13.5 (given in dollars, not log dollars). To illustrate, consider that females had higher average expenditures than males by looking at the “Average Expend” column. Breaking this down into frequency and amount of utilization, we see that females had a higher frequency of utilization but, when they had a positive utilization, the average (logarithmic) expenditure was lower than males. An examination of Table 16.1 shows this observation holds true for other explanatory variables. A variable’s effect on overall expenditures may be positive, negative, or non-significant; this effect can be quite different when we decompose expenditures into frequency and amount components. Table 16.2 compares the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to maximum likelihood estimates for the tobit model. From this table, we can see that there is a substantial agreement among the \\(t\\)-ratios for these fitted models. This agreement comes from examining the sign (positive or negative) and the magnitude (such as exceeding two for statistical significance) of each variable’s \\(t\\)-ratio. The regression coefficients also largely agree in sign. However, it is not surprising that the magnitudes of the regression coefficients differ substantially. This is because, from equation (16.2), we can see that the tobit coefficients measure the marginal change of the expected latent variable \\(y^{\\ast}\\), not the marginal change of the expected observed variable \\(y\\), as does OLS.

Table 16.2 also reports the fit using the two-stage Heckman algorithm. The coefficient associated with the inverse Mill’s ratio selection correction is statistically insignificant. Thus, there is general agreement between the OLS coefficients and those estimated using the two-stage algorithm. The two-stage \\(t\\)-ratios were calculated using heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, described in Section 5.7.2. Here, we see some disagreement between the \\(t\\)-ratios calculated using Heckman’s algorithm and the maximum likelihood values calculated using the tobit model. For example, GENDER, POOR, HINCOME, and MINCOME are statistically significant in the tobit model but are not in the two-stage algorithm. This is troubling because both techniques yield consistent estimators providing the assumptions of the tobit model are valid. Thus, we suspect the validity of the model assumptions for these data; the next section provides an alternative model that turns out to be more suitable for this dataset. 16.4 Two-Part Model One drawback of the tobit model is its reliance on the normality assumption of the latent response. A second, and more important, drawback is that a single latent variable dictates both the magnitude of the response as well as the censoring. As pointed out by Cragg (1971), there are many instances where the limiting amount represents a choice or activity that is separate from the magnitude. For example, in a population of smokers, zero cigarettes consumed during a week may simply represent a lower bound (or limit) and may be influenced by available time and money. However, in a general population, zero cigarettes consumed during a week can indicate that a person is a non-smoker, a choice that could be influenced by other lifestyle decisions (where time and money may or may not be relevant). As another example, when studying healthcare expenditures, a zero represents a person’s choice or decision not to utilize healthcare during a period. For many studies, the amount of healthcare expenditure is strongly influenced by a healthcare provider (such as a physician); the decision to utilize and the amount of healthcare can involve very different considerations. In the traditional actuarial literature (see for example Bowers et al. 1997, Chapter 2), the individual risk model decomposes a response, typically an insurance claim, into frequency (number) and severity (amount) components. Specifically, let \\(r_i\\) be a binary variable indicating whether or not the \\(i\\)th subject has an insurance claim and \\(y_i\\) describe the amount of the claim. Then, the claim is modeled as \\[ \\left( \\text{claim recorded}\\right)_i = r_i \\times y_i. \\] This is the basis for the two-part model, where we also use explanatory variables to understand the influence of each component. Definition. Two-Part Model Use a binary regression model with \\(r_i\\) as the dependent variable and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}\\) as the set of explanatory variables. Denote the corresponding set of regression coefficients as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{1}}\\). Typical models include the linear probability, logit, and probit models. Conditional on \\(r_i=1\\), specify a regression model with \\(y_i\\) as the dependent variable and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2i}\\) as the set of explanatory variables. Denote the corresponding set of regression coefficients as \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{2}}\\). Typical models include the linear and gamma regression models. \\end{enumerate} Unlike the tobit, in the two-part model one need not have the same set of explanatory variables influencing the frequency and amount of response. However, there is usually overlap in the sets of explanatory variables, where variables are members of both \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2}\\). Typically, one assumes that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{1}}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta_{2}}\\) are not related so that the joint likelihood of the data can be separated into two components and run separately, as described above. Example: MEPS Expenditure Data - Continued. Consider the Section 16.3 MEPS expenditure data using a probit model for the frequency and a linear regression model for the severity. Table 16.3 shows the results from using all explanatory variables to understand their influence on (i) the decision to seek healthcare (frequency) and (ii) the amount of healthcare utilized (severity). Unlike the Table 16.2 tobit model, the two-part models allow each variable to have a separate influence on frequency and severity. To illustrate, the full model results in Table 16.3 show that COLLEGE has no significant impact on frequency but a strong positive impact on severity. Because of the flexibility of the two-part model, one can also reduce the model complexity for each component by removing extraneous variables. Table 16.3 shows a reduced model, where age and mental health status variables have been removed from the frequency component; regional, educational, physical status, and income variables have been removed from the severity component.

Define \\(r_i=\\mathrm{I}\\left( r_i^{\\ast}&gt;0\\right)\\) to be the binary variable indicating that an amount has been observed. For the severity component, define \\[ y_i^{\\ast}=\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\eta_{2i} \\] to be the latent amount variable. The “observed” amount is \\[ y_i=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} y_i^{\\ast} &amp; \\mathrm{if~}r_i=1 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\mathrm{if~}r_i=0 \\end{array} \\right. . \\] Because responses are censored, the analyst is aware of the subject \\(i\\) and has covariate information even when \\(r_i = 0\\). If \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}=\\mathbf{x}_{2i}\\), \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}=\\boldsymbol \\beta _{2}\\) and \\(\\eta_{1i}=\\eta_{2i}\\), then this is the tobit framework with \\(d_i=0\\). If \\(\\boldsymbol\\beta_{1}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}\\) are not related and if \\(\\eta_{1i}\\) and \\(\\eta_{2i}\\) are independent, then this is the two-part framework. For the two-part framework, the likelihood of the observed responses \\(\\left\\{ r_i,y_i\\right\\}\\) is given by \\[\\begin{equation} L=\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{n}\\left\\{ \\left( p_i\\right) ^{r_i}\\left( 1-p_i\\right) ^{1-r_i}\\right\\} \\prod\\limits_{r_i=1}\\mathrm{\\phi } \\left( \\frac{y_i-\\mathbf{x}_{2i}^{\\prime} \\boldsymbol \\beta_{2}}{ \\sigma_{\\eta 2}}\\right) , \\tag{16.5} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p_i=\\Pr \\left( r_i=1\\right)\\) \\(=\\Pr \\left( \\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\mathbf{ \\prime }}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}+\\eta_{1i}&gt;0\\right)\\) \\(=1-\\Phi \\left( -\\mathbf{x}_{1i}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\right)\\) \\(=\\Phi \\left( \\mathbf{x} _{1i}^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\right)\\). Assuming that \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_1\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_2\\) are not related, one can separately maximize these two pieces of the likelihood function. In some instances, it is sensible to assume that the frequency and severity components are related. The tobit model considers a perfect relationship (with \\(\\eta_{1i}=\\eta_{2i}\\)) whereas the two-part models assumes independence. For an intermediate model, the tobit type II model allows for a non-zero correlation between \\(\\eta_{1i}\\) and \\(\\eta_{2i}\\). See Amemiya (1985) for additional details. Hsiao et al. (1990) provide an application of the tobit type II model to Canadian collision coverage of private passenger automobile experience. 16.5 Aggregate Loss Model We now consider two-part models where the frequency may exceed one. For example, if we are tracking automobile accidents, a policyholder may have more than one accident within a year. As another example, we may be interested in the claims for a city or a state and expect many claims per government unit. To establish notation, for each {\\(i\\)}, the observable responses consist of: \\(N_i~-\\) the number of claims (events), and \\(y_{ij},~j=1,...,N_i~-\\) the amount of each claim (loss). By convention, the set \\(\\{y_{ij}\\}\\) is empty when \\(N_i=0\\). If one uses \\(N_i\\) as a binary variable, then this framework reduces to the two-part set-up. Although we have detailed information on losses per event, the interest often is in , \\(S_i=y_{i1}+...+y_{i,N_i}\\). In traditional actuarial modeling, one assumes that the distribution of losses are, conditional on the frequency \\(N_i\\), identical and independent over replicates \\(~j\\). This representation is known as the , see, for example, Klugman et al. (2008). We also maintain this assumption. Data are typically available in two forms: \\(\\{N_i,y_{i1},...,y_{i,N_i}\\}\\), so that detailed information about each claim is available. For example, when examining personal automobile claims, losses for each claim are available. Let \\(\\mathbf{y}_i=\\left( y_{i1},...,y_{i,N_i}\\right) ^{\\prime}\\)  be the vector of individual losses. \\(\\{N_i,S_i\\}\\), so that only aggregate losses are available. For example, when examining losses at the city level, only aggregate losses are available. We are interested in both forms. Because there are multiple responses (events) per subject {\\(i\\)}, one might approach the analysis using multilevel models as described in, for example, Raudenbush and Bryk (2002). Unlike a multilevel structure, we consider data where the number of events are random that we wish to model stochastically and thus use an alternative framework. When only \\(\\{S_i\\}\\) is available, the Tweedie GLM introduced in Section 13.6 may be used. To see how to model these data, consider the first data form. Suppressing the \\(\\{i\\}\\) subscript, we decompose the joint distribution of the dependent variables as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray*} \\mathrm{f}\\left( N,\\mathbf{y}\\right) &amp;=&amp;\\mathrm{f}\\left( N\\right) ~\\times ~ \\mathrm{f}\\left( \\mathbf{y|}N\\right) \\\\ \\text{joint} &amp;=&amp;\\text{frequency~}\\times ~\\text{conditional severity,} \\end{eqnarray*}\\] where \\(\\mathrm{f}\\left( N,\\mathbf{y}\\right)\\) denotes the joint distribution of $( N,) $. This joint distribution equals the product of the two components: claims frequency: \\(\\mathrm{f}\\left( N\\right)\\) denotes the probability of having \\(N\\) claims; and conditional severity: \\(\\mathrm{f}\\left( \\mathbf{y|}N\\right)\\) denotes the conditional density of the claim vector \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) given \\(N\\). We represent the frequency and severity components of the aggregate loss model as follows. Use a count regression model with \\(N_i\\) as the dependent variable and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{1i}\\) as the set of explanatory variables. Denote the corresponding set of regression coefficients as \\(\\boldsymbol \\beta_{1}\\). Typical models include the Poisson and negative binomial models. Conditional on \\(N_i&gt;0\\), use a regression model with \\(y_{ij}\\) as the dependent variable and \\(\\mathbf{x}_{2i}\\) as the set of explanatory variables. Denote the corresponding set of regression coefficients as $ _{2}$. Typical models include the linear regression, gamma regression and mixed linear models. For the mixed linear models, one uses a subject-specific intercept to account for the heterogeneity among subjects. To model the second data form, the set-up is similar. The count data model in step 1 will not change. However, the regression model in step 2 will use $ S_i$ as the dependent variable. Because the dependent variable is the sum over \\(N_i\\) independent replicates, it may be that you will need to allow the variability to depend on \\(N_i\\). To get a sense of the empirical observations for claim frequency, we present the overall claim frequency. According to this table, there were a total of 2,000 observations of which 92.15% did not have any claims. There are a total of 203 (\\(=1\\times 130+2\\times 19+3\\times 2+4\\times 3+5\\times 2+6\\times 0+7\\times 1)\\) claims. Frequency of Claims \\[ \\small{ \\begin{array}{l|ccccccccc} \\hline \\text{Count} &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; \\text{Total }\\\\ \\hline \\text{Number} &amp; 1,843 &amp; 130 &amp; 19 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2,000 \\\\ \\text{Percentage} &amp; 92.15 &amp; 6.50 &amp; 0.95 &amp; 0.10 &amp; 0.15 &amp; 0.10 &amp; 0.00 &amp; 0.10 &amp; 100.00 \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} } \\] Table 16.4 summarizes the regression coefficient parameter fits using the negative binomial model. The results are comparable to the fitted probit models in Table 16.3, where many of the covariates are statistically significant predictors of claim frequency. This fitted frequency model is based on \\(n=2,000\\) persons. The Table 16.4 fitted severity models are based on \\(n_{1}+...+n_{2000}=203\\) claims. The gamma regression model is based on a logarithmic link \\[ \\mu_i=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^{\\prime}\\boldsymbol \\beta_2 \\right). \\] Table 16.4 shows that the results from fitting an ordinary regression model are similar to those from fitting the gamma regression model. They are similar in the sense that the sign and statistical significance of coefficients for each variable are comparable. As discussed in Chapter 13, the advantage of the ordinary regression model is its relatively simplicity involving ease of implementation and interpretation. In contrast, the gamma regression model can be a better model for fitting long-tail distributions such as medical expenditures. Table 16.4.

To distinguish this modeling from classical risk theory applications (see, for example, Klugman et al., 2008), we focus on cases where explanatory variables, such as policyholder characteristics, are available. There has been substantial interest in statistical modeling of claims frequency yet the literature on modeling claims severity, especially in conjunction with claims frequency, is less extensive. One possible explanation, noted by Coutts (1984), is that most of the variation in overall claims experience may be attributed to claim frequency (at least when inflation was small). Coutts (1984) also remarks that the first paper to analyze claim frequency and severity separately seems to be Kahane and Levy (1975). Brockman and Wright (1992) provide an early overview of how statistical modeling of claims and severity can be helpful for pricing automobile coverage. For computational convenience, they focused on categorical pricing variables to form cells that could be used with traditional insurance underwriting forms. Renshaw (1994) shows how generalized linear models can be used to analyze both the frequency and severity portions based on individual policyholder level data. Hsiao et al. (1990) note the “excess” number of zeros in policyholder claims data (due to no claims) and compare and contrast Tobit, two-part and simultaneous equation models, building on the work of Weisberg and Tomberlin (1982) and Weisberg et al. (1984). All of these papers use grouped data, not individual level data in this chapter. At the individual policyholder level, Frangos and Vrontos (2001) examined a claim frequency and severity model, using negative binomial and Pareto distributions, respectively. They used their statistical model to develop experience rated (bonus-malus) premiums. Pinquet (1997, 1998) provides a more modern statistical approach, fitting not only cross-sectional data but also following policyholders over time. Pinquet was interested in two lines of business, claims at fault and not at fault with respect to a third party. For each line, Pinquet hypothesized a frequency and severity component that were allowed to be correlated to one another. In particular, the claims frequency distribution was assumed to be bivariate Poisson. Severities were modeled using lognormal and gamma distributions. Healthcare The two-part model became prominent in the healthcare literature upon adoption by Rand Health Insurance Experiment researchers (Duan et al, 1983, Manning et al, 1987). They used the two-part model to analyze health insurance cost sharing’s effect on healthcare utilization and expenditures because of the close resemblance of the demand for medical care to the two decision-making processes. That is, the amount of healthcare expenditures is largely unaffected by an individual’s decision to seek treatment. This is because physicians, as the patients’ (principal) agents, would tend to decide the intensity of treatments as suggested by the principal-agent model of Zweifel (1981). The two-part model has become widely used in the healthcare literature despite some criticisms. For example, Maddala (1985) argued that two-part modeling is not appropriate for non-experimental data because individuals’ self-selection into different health insurance plans is an issue. (In the Rand Health Insurance Experiment, the self-selection aspect was not an issue because participants were randomly assigned to health insurance plans.) See Jones (2000) and Mullahy (1998) for overviews. Two-part models remain attractive in modeling healthcare usage because they provide insights into the determinants of initiation and level of healthcare usage. The decision to utilize healthcare by individuals is related primarily to personal characteristics whereas the cost per user may be more related to characteristics of the healthcare provider.

This appendix provides definitions and facts from a course in basic statistical inference that are needed in one’s study of regression analysis. Distributions of Functions of Random Variables Statistics and Sampling Distributions. A statistic summarizes information in a sample and hence is a function of observations \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\). Because observations are realizations of random variables, the study of distributions of functions of random variables is really the study of the distributions of statistics, known as sampling distributions. Linear combinations of the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i\\) represent an important type of function. Here, \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\) are known constants. To begin, we suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are mutually independent random variables with \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mu_i\\) and \\(\\mathrm{ Var~}y_i = \\sigma_i^2\\). Then, by the linearity of expectations, we have \\[ \\mathrm{E}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\mu_i~~~\\mathrm{and}~~~\\mathrm{Var}\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\sigma_i^2. \\] An important theorem in mathematical statistics is that, if each random variable is normally distributed, then linear combinations are also normally distributed. That is, we have: Linearity of Normal Random Variables. Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are mutually independent random variables with \\(y_i \\sim N(\\mu_i,\\sigma_i^2)\\). (Read ” \\(\\sim\\) ” to mean “is distributed as.”) Then, \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i y_i \\sim N\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\mu_i, \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 \\right) . \\] There are several applications of this important property. First, it can be checked that if \\(y \\sim N(\\mu ,\\sigma^2)\\), then \\((y - \\mu)/\\sigma \\sim N(0,1)\\). Second, assume that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are identically and independently distributed (i.i.d.) as \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) and take \\(a_i = n^{-1}\\). Then, we have \\[ \\overline{y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i \\sim N\\left( \\mu ,\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) . \\] Equivalently, \\(\\sqrt{n}\\left( \\overline{y}-\\mu \\right) /\\sigma\\) is standard normal. Thus, the important sample statistic \\(\\overline{y}\\) has a normal distribution. Further, the distribution of the sample variance \\(s_y^2\\) can also be calculated. For \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are i.i.d. \\(N(\\mu ,\\sigma^2)\\), we have that \\(\\left( n-1\\right) s_y^2 /\\sigma^2\\sim \\chi_{n-1}^2\\), a \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Further, \\(\\overline{y}\\) is independent of \\(s_y^2\\). From these two results, we have that \\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{n}}{s_y}\\left( \\overline{y}-\\mu \\right) \\sim t_{n-1}, \\] a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Estimation and Prediction Suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are i.i.d. random variables from a distribution that can be summarized by an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). We are interested in the quality of an estimate of \\(\\theta\\) and denote \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) as this estimator. For example, we consider \\(\\theta = \\mu\\) with \\(\\widehat{\\theta} = \\overline{y}\\) and \\(\\theta = \\sigma^2\\) with \\(\\widehat{\\theta} = s_y^2\\) as our leading examples. Point Estimation and Unbiasedness. Because \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) provides a (single) approximation of \\(\\theta\\), it is referred to as a point estimate of \\(\\theta\\). As a statistic, \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is a function of the observations \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) that varies from one sample to the next. Thus, values of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) vary from one sample to the next. To examine how close \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) tends to be to \\(\\theta\\), we examine several properties of \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\), in particular, the bias and consistency. A point estimator \\(\\widehat{\\theta}\\) is said to be an unbiased estimator of \\(\\theta\\) if \\(\\mathrm{E~}\\widehat{\\theta} = \\theta\\). For example, since \\(\\mathrm{E~}\\overline{y} = \\mu\\), \\(\\overline{y}\\) is an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mu\\). Finite Sample versus Large Sample Properties of Estimators. Biasedness is said to be a finite sample property since it is valid for each sample size \\(n\\). A limiting, or large sample property is consistency. Consistency is expressed in two ways, weak and strong consistency. An estimator is said to be weakly consistent if \\[ \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }\\Pr \\left( |\\widehat{\\theta }-\\theta |&lt;h\\right) = 1, \\] for each positive \\(h\\). An estimator is said to be strongly consistent if \\(\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty }~\\widehat{\\theta }=\\theta\\), with probability one. Least Squares Estimation Principle. In this text, two main estimation principles are used, least squares estimation and maximum likelihood estimation. For the least squares procedure, consider independent random variables \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) with means \\(\\mathrm{E~}y_i = \\mathrm{g}_i(\\theta )\\). Here, \\(\\mathrm{g}_i(.)\\) is a known function up to \\(\\theta\\), the unknown parameter. The least squares estimator is that value of \\(\\theta\\) that minimizes the sum of squares \\[ \\mathrm{SS}(\\theta )=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left( y_i-\\mathrm{g}_i(\\theta )\\right)^2. \\] Maximum Likelihood Estimation Principle. Maximum likelihood estimates are values of the parameter that are “most likely” to have been produced by the data. Consider the independent random variables \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) with probability function \\(\\mathrm{f}_i(a_i,\\theta )\\). Here, \\(\\mathrm{f}_i(a_i,\\theta )\\) is interpreted to be a probability mass function for discrete \\(y_i\\) or a probability density function for continuous \\(y_i\\), evaluated at \\(a_i\\), the realization of \\(y_i\\). The function \\(\\mathrm{f}_i(a_i,\\theta )\\) is assumed known up to \\(\\theta\\), the unknown parameter. The likelihood of the random variables \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) taking on values \\(a_1,\\ldots,a_n\\) is \\[ \\mathrm{L}(\\theta )=\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n \\mathrm{f}_i(a_i,\\theta ). \\] The value of \\(\\theta\\) that maximizes \\(\\mathrm{L}(\\theta )\\) is called the maximum likelihood estimator. Confidence Intervals. Although point estimates provide a single approximation to parameters, interval estimates provide a range that includes parameters with a certain prespecified level of probability, or confidence. A pair of statistics, \\(\\widehat{\\theta }_1\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\theta }_{2}\\), provide an interval of the form \\(\\left[ \\widehat{\\theta }_1 &lt; \\widehat{\\theta }_{2}\\right]\\). This interval is a \\(100(1-\\alpha )\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\theta\\) if \\[ \\Pr \\left( \\widehat{\\theta }_1 &lt; \\theta &lt; \\widehat{\\theta }_{2}\\right) \\geq 1-\\alpha . \\] For example, suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are i.i.d. \\(N(\\mu ,\\sigma^2)\\) random variables. Recall that \\(\\sqrt{n}\\left( \\overline{y}-\\mu\\right) /s_y\\sim t_{n-1}\\). This fact allows us to develop a \\(100(1-\\alpha )\\%\\) confidence interval for \\(\\mu\\) of the form \\(\\overline{y}\\pm (t-value)s_y/ \\sqrt{n}\\), where \\(t-value\\) is the \\((1-\\alpha /2)^{th}\\) percentile from a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Prediction Intervals. Prediction intervals have the same form as confidence intervals. However, a confidence interval provides a range for a parameter whereas a prediction interval provides a range for external values of the observations. Based on observations \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\), we seek to construct statistics \\(\\widehat{\\theta }_1\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\theta }_{2}\\) such that \\[ \\Pr \\left( \\widehat{\\theta }_1 &lt; y^{\\ast } &lt; \\widehat{\\theta }_{2}\\right) \\geq 1-\\alpha . \\] Here, \\(y^{\\ast }\\) is an additional observation that is not a part of the sample. Testing Hypotheses Null and Alternative Hypotheses and Test Statistics. An important statistical procedure involves verifying ideas about parameters. That is, before the data are observed, certain ideas about the parameters are formulated. In this text, we consider a null hypothesis of the form \\(H_0:\\theta =\\theta_0\\) versus an alternative hypothesis. We consider both a two-sided alternative, \\(H_{a}:\\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\), and one-sided alternatives, either \\(H_{a}:\\theta &gt;\\theta_0\\) or \\(H_{a}:\\theta &lt;\\theta_0\\). To choose between these competing hypotheses, we use a test statistic \\(T_n\\) that is typically a point estimate of \\(\\theta\\) or a version that is rescaled to conform to a reference distribution under \\(H_0\\). For example, to test \\(H_0:\\mu =\\mu_0\\), we often use \\(T_n= \\overline{y}\\) or \\(T_n=\\sqrt{n}\\left( \\overline{y}-\\mu_0\\right) /s_y\\). Note that the latter choice has a \\(t_{n-1}\\) distribution, under the assumptions of i.i.d. normal data. Rejection Regions and Significance Level. With a statistic in hand, we now establish a criterion for deciding between the two competing hypotheses. This can be done by establishing a rejection, or critical, region. The critical region consists of all possible outcomes of \\(T_n\\) that leads us to reject \\(H_0\\) in favor of \\(H_{a}\\). In order to specify the critical region, we first quantify the types of errors that can be made in the decision-making procedure. A Type I error consists of rejecting \\(H_0\\) falsely and a Type II error consists of rejecting \\(H_{a}\\) falsely. The probability of a Type I error is called the significance level. Prespecifying the significance level is often enough to determine the critical region. For example, suppose that \\(y_1,\\ldots,y_n\\) are i.i.d. \\(N(\\mu ,\\sigma^2)\\) and we are interested in deciding between \\(H_0:\\mu =\\mu_0\\) and \\(H_{a}:\\mu &gt; \\mu_0\\). Thinking of our test statistic \\(T_n=\\overline{y}\\), we know that we would like to reject \\(H_0\\) if \\(\\overline{y}\\) is larger than \\(\\mu_0\\). The question is how much larger? Specifying a significance level \\(\\alpha\\), we wish to find a critical region of the form \\(\\{\\overline{y}&gt;c\\}\\) for some constant \\(c\\). To this end, we have \\[ \\begin{array}{ll} \\alpha &amp;= \\Pr \\mathrm{(Type~I~error)} = \\Pr (\\mathrm{Reject~}H_0 \\mathrm{~assuming~} H_0:\\mu =\\mu_0 \\mathrm{~is~true)} \\\\ &amp; = \\Pr (\\overline{y}&gt;c) = \\Pr \\left(\\sqrt{n}\\left( \\overline{y}-\\mu_0\\right)/s_y&gt;\\sqrt{n}\\left( c-\\mu_0 \\right)/s_y\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\Pr \\left(t_{n-1}&gt;\\sqrt{n}\\left( c-\\mu_0 \\right)/s_y\\right). \\end{array} \\] With \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom, we have that \\(t-value = \\sqrt{n}\\left( c-\\mu_0\\right)/s_y\\) where the \\(t-value\\) is the \\((1-\\alpha)^{th}\\) percentile from a \\(t\\)-distribution. Thus, solving for \\(c\\), our critical region is of the form \\(\\{\\overline{y} &gt; \\mu_0 + (t-value)/s_y/\\sqrt{n}\\}\\). Relationship between Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Tests. Similar calculations show, for testing \\(H_0:\\mu = \\mu_0\\) versus \\(H_{a}:\\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\), that the critical region is of the form \\[ \\{ \\overline{y} &gt; \\mu_0 + (t-value)/s_y/\\sqrt{n} ~\\mathrm{or~} \\overline{y} &gt; \\mu_0 + (t-value)/s_y/\\sqrt{n}\\} . \\] Here, the \\(t\\)-value is a \\((1-\\alpha /2)^{th}\\) percentile from a \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df=n-1\\) degrees of freedom. It is interesting to note that the event of falling in this two-sided critical region is equivalent to the event of \\(\\mu_0\\) falling outside the confidence interval \\(\\overline{y}\\pm (t-value)s_y/\\sqrt{n}\\). This establishes the fact that confidence intervals and hypothesis tests are really reporting the same evidence with different emphasis on interpretation of the statistical inference. \\(p\\)-value. Another useful concept in hypothesis testing is the \\(p\\)-value, which is short for probability value. For a data set, a \\(p\\)-value is defined to be the smallest significance level for which the null hypothesis would be rejected. The \\(p\\)-value is a useful summary statistic for the data analyst to report since it allows the reader to understand the strength of the deviation from the null hypothesis. Appendix A2. Matrix Algebra Basic Definitions Matrix - a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns (the plural of matrix is matrices). Dimension of the matrix - the number of rows and columns of the matrix. Consider a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) that has dimension \\(m \\times k\\). Let \\(a_{ij}\\) be the symbol for the number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In general, we work with matrices of the form \\[ \\mathbf{A} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{1k} \\\\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} &amp; a_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; a_{mk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Vector - a (column) vector is a matrix containing only one row (\\(m=1\\)). Row vector - a matrix containing only one column (\\(k=1\\)). Transpose - transpose of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is defined by interchanging the rows and columns and is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\) (or \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\)). Thus, if \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) has dimension \\(m \\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\) has dimension \\(k \\times m\\). Square matrix - a matrix where the number of rows equals the number of columns, that is, \\(m=k\\). Diagonal element – the number in the \\(r\\)th row and column of a square matrix, \\(r=1,2,\\ldots\\) Diagonal matrix - a square matrix where all non-diagonal numbers are equal to zero. Identity matrix - a diagonal matrix where all the diagonal elements are equal to one and is denoted by \\(\\mathbf{I}\\). Symmetric matrix - a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) such that the matrix remains unchanged if we interchange the roles of the rows and columns, that is, if \\(\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\). Note that a diagonal matrix is a symmetric matrix. Review of Basic Operations Scalar multiplication. Let \\(c\\) be a real number, called a scalar (a \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix). Multiplying a scalar \\(c\\) by a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is denoted by \\(c \\mathbf{A}\\) and defined by \\[ c\\mathbf{A} = \\left( \\begin{array}{cccc} ca_{11} &amp; ca_{12} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{1k} \\\\ ca_{21} &amp; ca_{22} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{2k} \\\\ \\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ ca_{m1} &amp; ca_{m2} &amp; \\cdots &amp; ca_{mk} \\end{array} \\right) . \\] Matrix addition and subtraction. Let \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) be matrices, each with dimension \\(m \\times k\\). Use \\(a_{ij}\\) and \\(b_{ij}\\) to denote the numbers in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), respectively. Then, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} + \\mathbf{B}\\) is defined to be the matrix with the number \\((a_{ij} + b_{ij})\\) to denote the number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Similarly, the matrix \\(\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} - \\mathbf{B}\\) is defined to be the matrix with the number \\((a_{ij} - b_{ij})\\) to denote the numbers in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column. Matrix multiplication. If \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(m \\times c\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(c \\times k\\), then \\(\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{B}\\) is a matrix of dimension \\(m \\times k\\). The number in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of \\(\\mathbf{C}\\) is \\(\\sum_{s=1}^c a_{is} b_{sj}\\). Determinant - a function of a square matrix, denoted by \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A})\\), or \\(|\\mathbf{A}|\\). For a \\(1 \\times 1\\) matrix, the determinant is \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = a_{11}\\). To define determinants for larger matrices, we need two additional concepts. Let \\(\\mathbf{A}_{rs}\\) be the \\((m-1) \\times (m-1)\\) submatrix of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) defined by removing the \\(r\\)th row and \\(s\\)th column. Recursively, define \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sum_{s=1}^m (-1)^{r+s} a_{rs} \\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}_{rs})\\), for any \\(r=1,\\ldots,m\\). For example, for \\(m=2\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21}\\). Matrix inverse. In matrix algebra, there is no concept of division. Instead, we extend the concept of reciprocals of real numbers. To begin, suppose that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a square matrix of dimension \\(m \\times m\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) \\neq 0\\). Further, let \\(\\mathbf{I}\\) be the \\(m \\times m\\) identity matrix. If there exists a \\(m \\times m\\) matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{AB = I = BA}\\), then \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) is called the inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and is written as \\(\\mathbf{B} = \\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\). Further Definitions Linearly dependent vectors – a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{c}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{c}_{k}\\) is said to be linearly dependent if one of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of the others. Linearly independent vectors – a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{c}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{c}_{k}\\) is said to be linearly independent if they are not linearly dependent. Specifically, a set of vectors \\(\\mathbf{c}_{1},\\ldots,\\mathbf{c}_{k}\\) is said to be linearly independent if and only if the only solution of the equation \\(x_{1}\\mathbf{c}_{1} + \\ldots + x_{k}\\mathbf{c}_{k} = 0\\) is \\(x_{1} = \\ldots = x_{k} = 0\\). Rank of a matrix – the largest number of linearly independent columns (or rows) of a matrix. Singular matrix – a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) = 0\\). Non-singular matrix – a square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) such that \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A}) \\neq 0\\). Positive definite matrix – a symmetric square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Ax} &gt; 0\\) for \\(\\mathbf{x} \\neq 0\\). Non-negative definite matrix – a symmetric square matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{Ax} \\geq 0\\) for \\(\\mathbf{x} \\neq 0\\). Orthogonal – two matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) are orthogonal if \\(\\mathbf{A}^{\\prime}\\mathbf{B} = 0\\), a zero matrix. Idempotent – a square matrix such that \\(\\mathbf{AA = A}\\). Trace – the sum of all diagonal elements of a square matrix. Eigenvalues – the solutions of the \\(n\\)th degree polynomial \\(\\mathrm{det}(\\mathbf{A} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0\\). Also known as characteristic roots and latent roots. Eigenvector – a vector \\(\\mathbf{x}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{Ax} = \\lambda \\mathbf{x}\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). Also known as a characteristic vector and latent vector. Generalized inverse - of a matrix \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is a matrix \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) such that \\(\\mathbf{ABA = A}\\). We use the notation \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-}\\) to denote the generalized inverse of \\(\\mathbf{A}\\). In the case that \\(\\mathbf{A}\\) is invertible, then \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-}\\) is unique and equals \\(\\mathbf{A}^{-1}\\). Although there are several definitions of generalized inverses, the above definition suffices for our purposes. See Searle (1987) for further discussion of alternative definitions of generalized inverses. Gradient vector – a vector of partial derivatives. If \\(\\mathrm{f}(.)\\) is a function of the vector \\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\\ldots,x_m)^{\\prime}\\), then the gradient vector is \\(\\partial \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\mathbf{x}\\). The \\(i\\)th row of the gradient vector is \\(\\partial \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{x})/\\partial x_i\\). Hessian matrix – a matrix of second derivatives. If \\(\\mathrm{f}(.)\\) is a function of the vector \\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,\\ldots,x_m)^{\\prime}\\), then the Hessian matrix is \\(\\partial^2 \\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{x})/\\partial \\mathbf{x}\\partial \\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}\\). The element in the \\(i\\)th row and \\(j\\)th column of the Hessian matrix is \\(\\partial^{2}\\mathrm{f}(\\mathbf{x})/\\partial x_i\\partial x_j\\). Appendix A3. Probability Tables Normal Distribution Recall from equation (1.1) that the probability density function is defined by \\[ \\mathrm{f}(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 }\\left( y-\\mu \\right)^2\\right) \\] where \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\) are parameters that describe the curve. In this case, we write \\(y \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\). Straightforward calculations show that \\[ \\mathrm{E}~y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y \\mathrm{f}(y) \\, dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 }\\left( y-\\mu \\right)^2 \\right) \\, dy = \\mu \\] and \\[ \\mathrm{Var}~y = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (y-\\mu)^2 \\mathrm{f}(y) \\, dy = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (y-\\mu)^2 \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi }}\\exp \\left( -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2 }\\left( y-\\mu \\right)^2 \\right) \\, dy = \\sigma^2 . \\] Thus, the notation \\(y \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma^2)\\) is interpreted to mean the random variable is distributed normally with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). If \\(y \\sim N(0,1)\\), then \\(y\\) is said to be standard normal.

For example, \\(\\Pr ( y \\le 0.1) = 0.5398\\). Chi-Square Distribution Chi-Square Distribution. Several important distributions can be linked to the normal distribution. If \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) are i.i.d. random variables such that each \\(y_i \\sim N(0,1)\\), then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2\\) is said to have a chi-square distribution with parameter \\(n\\). More generally, a random variable \\(w\\) with probability density function \\[ \\mathrm{f}(w) = \\frac{2^{-k/2}}{\\Gamma(k/2)} w^{k/2-1} \\exp (-w/2), ~~~~~~w &gt; 0 \\] is said to have a chi-square with \\(df = k\\) degrees of freedom, written \\(w \\sim \\chi_k^2\\). Easy calculations show that for \\(w \\sim \\chi_k^2\\), we have \\(\\mathrm{E}~w = k\\) and \\(\\mathrm{Var}~w = 2k\\). In general, the degrees of freedom parameter need not be an integer, although it is for the applications of this text. Figure 17.2: Several chi-square probability density functions. Shown are curves for \\(df\\) = 3, \\(df\\) = 5, and \\(df\\) = 10. Greater degrees of freedom lead to curves that are less skewed.
